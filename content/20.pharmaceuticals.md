## Identification and Development of Therapeutics for COVID-19

### Introduction

The novel coronavirus _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2_ (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and quickly precipitated the worldwide spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
COVID-19 is associated with symptoms ranging from none (asymptomatic) to mild to severe, with approximately 2% of patients dying from COVID-19-related complications, such as acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) [@individual-pathogenesis].
The virus is likely spread between people primarily by droplets, with the role of contact and aerosol transmission still in question [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12458; @doi:10/gg6br7].
As a result, public health guidelines have been critical to efforts to control the spread of the virus.
However, as of early 2021, COVID-19 remains a significant worldwide concern (Figure @fig:csse-deaths), with cases in some places surging far above the numbers reported during the initial outbreak in early 2020.
Due to the continued threat of the virus and the severity of the disease, the identification and development of therapeutic interventions have emerged as significant international priorities.
Fortunately, prior developments during other recent pandemics, especially those caused by human coronaviruses (HCoV), have provided a number of hypotheses guiding a biomedical approach to the novel coronavirus infection.
However, previous emerging disease threats have been controlled much more quickly than SARS-CoV-2 through public health efforts (Figure @fig:csse-deaths), which has made the repurposing and development of pharmaceuticals uniquely important in the face of this crisis.

Previous emergent viral threats had a much lower death toll that was not felt on a such a global scale, and in most cases were controlled much more quickly.
For example, SARS-CoV-1 was controlled within 9 months of its appearance, whereas SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant global threat almost 1.5 years later.

#### Lessons from Prior HCoV Outbreaks

SARS-CoV-2's rapid shift from an unknown virus to a significant worldwide threat closely parallels the emergence of _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ (SARS-CoV-1).
The first documented case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China in November 2019, and the disease quickly spread worldwide during the early months of 2020.
Similarly, the first case of SARS was reported in November 2002 in the Guangdong Province of China, and it spread within China and then into several countries across continents over the following months [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029; @doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
In fact, genome sequencing quickly revealed the virus causing COVID-19 to be a novel betacoronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-1 [@doi:10.46234/ccdcw2020.017].

There are many similarities but also some differences in the characteristics of the two viruses that determine how they spread.
SARS-CoV-1 infection is severe, with an estimated death rate for SARS of 9.5% [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029], while estimates of the death rate associated with COVID-19 are much lower, at approximately 2% [@individual-pathogenesis].
SARS-CoV-1 is highly contagious via droplet transmission and has a basic reproduction number (R~0~) of 4 (i.e., each person infected was estimated to infect four other people) [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
SARS-CoV-2 also appears to be spread primarily by droplet transmission [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12458; @doi:10/gg6br7], and most estimates of its R~0~ fall between 2.5 and 3 [@individual-pathogenesis].
However, the 17-year difference in the timing of these two outbreaks has led to some major differences in the tools available for the international community's response.
At the time that SARS-CoV-1 emerged, no new HCoV had been identified in almost 40 years [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
The identity of the virus underlying the SARS disease remained unknown until April of 2003, when the SARS-CoV-1 virus was characterized through a worldwide scientific effort spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO) [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was released on January 3, 2020 [@doi:10.46234/ccdcw2020.017], only days after the international community became aware of the novel pneumonia-like illness now known as COVID-19.
While SARS-CoV-1 belonged to a distinct lineage from the two other HCoVs known at the time of its discovery [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029], SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV-1 and a more distant relative of another HCoV characterized in 2012, _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ [@doi:10/ggjr43; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1211721].

Despite their phylogenetic similarity, SARS-CoV-2 emerged under very different circumstances than SARS-CoV-1 in terms of scientific knowledge about HCoVs.
The trajectories of the pandemics associated with each of the viruses have also diverged significantly.
By July 2003, the SARS outbreak was officially determined to be under control, with the success credited to infection management practices such as mask wearing [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
In contrast, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is still circulating and remains a concern; although the fatality rate is very high at almost 35%, the disease is much less easily transmitted, as its R~0~ has been estimated to be 1 [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
The low R~0~ in combination with public health practices allowed for its spread to be contained [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
Neither of these trajectories are comparable to that of SARS-CoV-2, which remains a serious threat worldwide more than a year after the first cases of COVID-19 emerged.

Current results suggest that pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 appear to be more successful than the previous efforts to develop therapeutics for SARS and MERS.
Care for SARS and MERS patients prioritized supportive care and symptom management [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
To the extent that clinical treatments for SARS and MERS were explored, there is generally a lack of evidence supporting their efficacy.
For example, Ribavirin is an antiviral that was often used in combination with corticosteroids and sometimes interferon (IFN) medications to treat SARS and MERS [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81], but its effects have been found to be inconclusive in retrospective and _in vitro_ analyses of SARS and the SARS-CoV-1 virus, respectively [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
IFNs and Ribavirin have shown promise in _in vitro_ analyses of MERS, but their clinical effectiveness remains unknown [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
Therefore, only limited pharmaceutical advances from prior HCoV outbreaks can be adopted to COVID-19.
Importantly, though, prior analyses of the virological and pathogenic properties of SARS-CoV-1 and _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ (MERS-CoV) have provided a strong foundation for the development of hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 that have served to accelerated the development and identification of potential therapeutic approaches.
Even during the early months of the pandemic, a number of studies have emerged investigating the potential effects of drugs with mechanisms suggested based on prior understanding of coronavirus-host interactions.
Initially, these were primarily observational studies, which simply compare groups of patients who did and did not receive a treatment to determine whether it may have an effect.
However, these studies are subject to confounding, and randomized controlled trials are the standard means of assessing the effects of medications.
In randomized controlled trials, patients are prospectively and randomly assigned to treatment conditions, allowing for much stronger interpretations to be drawn; however, data from these trials takes much longer to collect.
Both have proven to be important sources of information during the COVID-19 crisis, but as more results are released from randomized controlled trials, more definitive answers are becoming available about various proposed therapeutics.
