## Identification and Development of Therapeutics for COVID-19

### Abstract

After emerging in China in late 2019, the novel _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus 2_ (SARS-CoV-2) spread worldwide and as of mid-2021 continues to significantly impact most countries.
Only a small number of coronaviruses are known to infect humans, and only two cause infections similar in severity to SARS-CoV-2: _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_, a closely related species of SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2002, and _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_, which emerged in 2012.
Unlike in the current pandemic, both of these previous epidemics were controlled relatively rapidly through public health measures.
All the same, the body of research investigating severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has proven valuable for identifying approaches to treating and preventing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Building on research in these and other diseases, the medical and scientific communities have responded rapidly to the COVID-19 crisis and identified a large number of candidate therapeutics.
The approaches used to identify these candidates have fallen into four main categories: adaptation of approaches used clinically for related diseases or diseases with related pathologies, adaptation based on virological properties, adaptation based on host response, and data-driven identification of candidates based on physical properties or on pharmacological compendia.
To date, a small number of therapeutics have already been authorized by regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, and many others remain under investigation.
The scale of the COVID-19 crisis offers a rare opportunity to collect data on the success of treatments given the high risk of exposure and infection.
This information can provide insight not only into the management of coronavirus diseases, but also into the relative success of different approaches to identifying candidate therapeutics against an emerging disease.

### Importance

The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving crisis.
With the worldwide scientific community shifting focus onto the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19, a large number of possible pharmaceutical approaches for treatment and prevention have been proposed.
What was known about each of these potential interventions evolved rapidly throughout 2020 and 2021.
This fast-paced area of research provides important insight into how the ongoing pandemic can be managed and also demonstrates the power of interdisciplinary collaboration to rapidly understand a virus and match its characteristics with existing or novel pharmaceuticals.
As illustrated by the continued threat of viral epidemics during the current millennium, a rapid and strategic response to emerging viral threats can save lives.
In this review, we explore how different modes of identifying candidate therapeutics have borne out during COVID-19.

### Introduction

The novel coronavirus _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2_ (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and quickly precipitated the worldwide spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
COVID-19 is associated with symptoms ranging from mild or even asymptomatic to severe, and up to 2% of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 die from COVID-19-related complications such as acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) [@individual-pathogenesis].
As a result, public health efforts have been critical to mitigating the spread of the virus.
However, as of mid-2021, COVID-19 remains a significant worldwide concern (Figure @fig:csse-deaths), with 2021 cases in some regions surging far above the numbers reported during the initial outbreak in early 2020.
While a number of vaccines have been developed and approved in different countries starting in late 2020 [@individual-vaccines], vaccination efforts have not proceeded at the same pace throughout the world and are not yet close to ending the pandemic.

Due to the continued threat of the virus and the severity of the disease, the identification and development of therapeutic interventions have emerged as significant international priorities.
Prior developments during other recent outbreaks of emerging diseases, especially those caused by human coronaviruses (HCoV), have guided biomedical research into the behavior and treatment of this novel coronavirus infection.
However, previous emerging HCoV-related disease threats were controlled much more quickly than SARS-CoV-2 through public health efforts (Figure @fig:csse-deaths).
The scale of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the repurposing and development of pharmaceuticals more urgent than in previous coronavirus epidemics.

#### Lessons from Prior HCoV Outbreaks

![
**Cumulative global incidence of COVID-19 and SARS.**
As of {{csse_date_pretty}}, {{csse_cases}} COVID-19 cases and {{csse_deaths}} COVID-19 deaths had been reported worldwide since January 22, 2020.
A total of 8,432 cases and 813 deaths were reported for SARS from March 17 to July 11, 2003.
SARS-CoV-1 was officially contained on July 5, 2003, within 9 months of its appearance [@doi:10.3390/ijerph17113973].
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant global threat nearly two years after its emergence.
COVID-19 data are from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University [@https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series; @doi:10/ggnsjk].
SARS data are from the WHO [@url:https://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/en] and were obtained from a dataset on GitHub [@url:https://github.com/imdevskp/sars-2003-outbreak-data-webscraping-code].
]({{csse_deaths_figure}} "Global incidence of COVID-19 and SARS"){#fig:csse-deaths secno=1}

At first, SARS-CoV-2's rapid shift from an unknown virus to a significant worldwide threat closely paralleled the emergence of _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ (SARS-CoV-1), which was responsible for the 2002-03 SARS epidemic.
The first documented case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China in November 2019, and the disease quickly spread worldwide in the early months of 2020.
In comparison, the first case of SARS was reported in November 2002 in the Guangdong Province of China, and it spread within China and then into several countries across continents during the first half of 2003 [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029; @doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81; @doi:10.3390/ijerph17113973].
In fact, genome sequencing quickly revealed the virus causing COVID-19 to be a novel betacoronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-1 [@doi:10.46234/ccdcw2020.017].

While similarities between these two viruses are unsurprising given their close phylogenetic relationship, there are also some differences in how the viruses affect humans.
SARS-CoV-1 infection is severe, with an estimated case fatality rate (CFR) for SARS of 9.5% [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029], while estimates of the CFR associated with COVID-19 are much lower, at up to 2% [@individual-pathogenesis].
SARS-CoV-1 is highly contagious and spread primarily by droplet transmission, with a basic reproduction number (R~0~) of 4 (i.e., each person infected was estimated to infect four other people) [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
There is still some controversy whether SARS-CoV-2 is primarily spread by droplets or is primarily airborne [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12458; @doi:10/gg6br7; @doi:10/gjqmvq; @doi:10.1136/bmj.n913]. 
Most estimates of its R~0~ fall between 2.5 and 3 [@individual-pathogenesis].
Therefore, SARS is thought to be a deadlier and more transmissible disease than COVID-19.

With the 17-year difference between these two outbreaks, there were major differences in the tools available to efforts to organize international responses.
At the time that SARS-CoV-1 emerged, no new HCoV had been identified in almost 40 years [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
The identity of the virus underlying the SARS disease remained unknown until April of 2003, when the SARS-CoV-1 virus was characterized through a worldwide scientific effort spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO) [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was released on January 3, 2020 [@doi:10.46234/ccdcw2020.017], only days after the international community became aware of the novel pneumonia-like illness now known as COVID-19.
While SARS-CoV-1 belonged to a distinct lineage from the two other HCoVs known at the time of its discovery [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029], SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV-1 and is a more distant relative of another HCoV characterized in 2012, _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ [@doi:10/ggjr43; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1211721].
Significant efforts had been dedicated towards understanding SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV and how they interact with human hosts.
Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 emerged under very different circumstances than SARS-CoV-1 in terms of scientific knowledge about HCoVs and the tools available to characterize them.

Despite the apparent advantages for responding to SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19 has caused many orders of magnitude more deaths than SARS did (Figure @fig:csse-deaths).
The SARS outbreak was officially determined to be under control in July 2003, with the success credited to infection management practices such as mask wearing [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
_Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ (MERS-CoV) is still circulating and remains a concern; although the fatality rate is very high at almost 35%, the disease is much less easily transmitted, as its R~0~ has been estimated to be 1 [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
The low R~0~ in combination with public health practices allowed for its spread to be contained [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
Neither of these trajectories are comparable to that of SARS-CoV-2, which remains a serious threat worldwide over a year and a half after the first cases of COVID-19 emerged (Figure @fig:csse-deaths).

#### Potential Approaches to the Treatment of COVID-19

Therapeutic interventions can utilize two approaches: they can either mitigate the effects of an infection that harms an infected person, or they can hinder the spread of infection within a host by disrupting the viral life cycle.
The goal of the former strategy is to reduce the severity and risks of an active infection, while for the latter, it is to inhibit the replication of a virus once an individual is infected, potentially freezing disease progression.
Additionally, two major approaches can be used to identify interventions that might be relevant to managing an emerging disease or a novel virus: drug repurposing and drug development.
Drug repurposing involves identifying an existing compound that may provide benefits in the context of interest [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.168].
This strategy can focus on either approved or investigational drugs, for which there may be applicable preclinical or safety information [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.168].
Drug development, on the other hand, provides an opportunity to identify or develop a compound specifically relevant to a particular need, but it is often a lengthy and expensive process characterized by repeated failure [@doi:10.1016/j.trci.2017.10.005].
Drug repurposing therefore tends to be emphasized in a situation like the COVID-19 pandemic due to the potential for a more rapid response.

Even from the early months of the pandemic, studies began releasing results from analyses of approved and investigational drugs in the context of COVID-19.
The rapid timescale of this response meant that, initially, most evidence came from observational studies, which compare groups of patients who did and did not receive a treatment to determine whether it may have had an effect.
This type of study can be conducted rapidly but is subject to confounding.
In contrast, randomized controlled trials are the gold-standard method for assessing the effects of an intervention.
Here, patients are prospectively and randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions, allowing for much stronger interpretations to be drawn; however, data from these trials take much longer to collect.
Both approaches have proven to be important sources of information in the development of a rapid response to the COVID-19 crisis, but as the pandemic draws on and more results become available from randomized controlled trials, more definitive answers are becoming available about proposed therapeutics.
Interventional clinical trials are currently investigating or have investigated a large number of possible therapeutics and combinations of therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 (Figure @fig:ebm-trials).

![
**COVID-19 clinical trials.**
Trials data are from the University of Oxford Evidence-Based Medicine Data Lab's COVID-19 TrialsTracker [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3732709].
As of {{ebm_date_pretty}}, there were {{ebm_all_trials}} COVID-19 clinical trials of which {{ebm_interv_trials}} were interventional.
The study types include only types used in at least five trials.
Only interventional trials are analyzed in the figures depicting status, phase, and intervention.
Of the interventional trials, {{ebm_trials_results}} trials had reported results as of {{ebm_date_pretty}}.
Recruitment status and trial phase are shown only for interventional trials in which the status or phase is recorded.
Common interventions refers to interventions used in at least ten trials.
Combinations of interventions, such as hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, are tallied separately from the individual interventions.
]({{ebm_trials_figure}} "COVID-19 clinical trials"){#fig:ebm-trials secno=1}

The purpose of this review is to provide an evolving resource tracking the status of efforts to repurpose and develop drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.
We highlight four strategies that provide different paradigms for the identification of potential pharmaceutical treatments.
The WHO guidelines [@doi:10.1136/bmj.m3379] and a systematic review [@doi:10.1136/bmj.m2980] are complementary living documents that summarize COVID-19 therapeutics.


### Repurposing Drugs for Symptom Management

A variety of symptom profiles with a range of severity are associated with COVID-19 [@individual-pathogenesis].
In many cases, COVID-19 is not life threatening.
A study of COVID-19 patients in a hospital in Berlin, Germany reported that the highest risk of death was associated with infection-related symptoms, such as sepsis, respiratory symptoms such as ARDS, and cardiovascular failure or pulmonary embolism [@doi:10.1101/2020.06.15.20131540].
Similarly, an analysis in Wuhan, China reported that respiratory failure (associated with ARDS) and sepsis/multi-organ failure accounted for 69.5% and 28.0% of deaths, respectively, among 82 deceased patients [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0235458].
COVID-19 is characterized by two phases.
The first is the acute response, where an adaptive immune response to the virus is established and in many cases can mitigate viral damage to organs [@doi:10.1038/s41418-020-0530-3].
The second phase characterizes more severe cases of COVID-19.
Here, patients experience a cytokine storm, whereby excessive production of cytokines floods into circulation, leading to systemic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and multiorgan dysfunction that can cause multiorgan failure and death if untreated [@doi:10.1056/NEJMra2026131].
ARDS-associated respiratory failure can occur during this phase.
Cytokine dysregulation was also identified in patients with SARS [@doi:10/c8mmbg; @doi:10.1186/cc2452]. 

In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians sought to identify potential treatments that could benefit patients, and in some cases shared their experiences and advice with the medical community on social media sites such as Twitter [@doi:10.7759/cureus.13594].
These on-the-ground treatment strategies could later be analyzed retrospectively in observational studies or investigated in an interventional paradigm through randomized controlled studies.
Several notable cases involved the use of small-molecule drugs, which are synthesized compounds of low molecular weight, typically less than 1 kilodalton (kDa) [@url:https://www.nuventra.com/resources/blog/small-molecules-versus-biologics].
Small-molecule pharmaceutical agents have been a backbone of drug development since the discovery of penicillin in the early twentieth century [@doi:10.1126/science.287.5460.1960].
It and other antibiotics have long been among the best known applications of small molecules to therapeutics, but biotechnological developments such as the prediction of protein-protein interactions have facilitated advances in precise targeting of specific structures using small molecules [@doi:10.1126/science.287.5460.1960].
Small molecule drugs today encompass a wide range of therapeutics beyond antibiotics, including antivirals, protein inhibitors, and many broad-spectrum pharmaceuticals.

Many treatments considered for COVID-19 have relied on a broad-spectrum approach.
These treatments do not specifically target a virus or particular host receptor, but rather induce broad shifts in host biology that are hypothesized to be potential inhibitors of the virus.
This approach relies on the fact that when a virus enters a host, the host becomes the virus's environment.
Therefore, the state of the host can also influence the virus's ability to replicate and spread.
The administration and assessment of broad-spectrum small-molecule drugs on a rapid time course was feasible because they are often either available in hospitals, or in some cases may also be prescribed to a large number of out-patients.
One of the other advantages is that these well-established compounds, if found to be beneficial, are often widely available, in contrast to boutique experimental drugs.

In some cases, prior data was available from experiments examining the response of other HCoVs or HCoV infections to a candidate drug.
In addition to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as encouraging non-intubated patients to adopt a prone position [@doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.3030], knowledge about interactions between HCoVs and the human body, many of which emerged from SARS and MERS research over the past two decades, led to the suggestion that a number of common drugs might benefit COVID-19 patients.
However, the short duration and low case numbers of prior outbreaks were less well-suited to the large-scale study of clinical applications than the COVID-19 pandemic is.
As a result, COVID-19 has presented the first opportunity to robustly evaluate treatments that were common during prior HCoV outbreaks to determine their clinical efficacy.
The first year of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that there are several different trajectories that these clinically suggested, widely available candidates can follow when assessed against a widespread, novel viral threat.

One approach to identifying candidate small molecule drugs was to look at the approaches used to treat SARS and MERS.
Treatment of SARS and MERS patients prioritized supportive care and symptom management [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
Among the clinical treatments for SARS and MERS that were explored, there was generally a lack of evidence indicating whether they were effective.
Most of the supportive treatments for SARS were found inconclusive in meta-analysis [@doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0030343], and a 2004 review reported that not enough evidence was available to make conclusions about most treatments [@doi:10.1007/s10156-003-0296-9].
However, one strategy adopted from prior HCoV outbreaks is currently the best-known treatment for severe cases of COVID-19.
Corticosteroids represent broad-spectrum treatments and are a well-known, widely available treatment for pneumonia [@doi:10.1002/14651858.CD007720.pub3; @doi:10.1002/14651858.CD007720.pub2; @doi:10.1183/09031936.00154107; @doi:10.1007/s00408-007-9020-3; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0047926; @doi:10.1186/cc10103] that have also been debated as a possible treatment for ARDS [@doi:10/ggpxzc; @doi:10/gcv2; @doi:10.1378/chest.06-1743; @doi:10.1378/chest.07-0714; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa051693; @doi:10.1136/bmj.39537.939039.BE].
Corticosteroids were also used and subsequently evaluated as possible supportive care for SARS and MERS.
In general, studies and meta-analyses did not identify support for corticosteroids to prevent mortality in these HCoV infections [@doi:10.1136/thx.2003.017665; @doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2006.01.005; @doi:10.1038/s41375-020-0848-3]; however, one found that the effects might be masked by variability in treatment protocols, such as dosage and timing [@doi:10.1007/s10156-003-0296-9].
While the corticosteroids most often used to treat SARS were methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone, availability issues for these drugs at the time led to dexamethasone also being used in North America [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp030072].

Dexamethasone (9&alpha;-fluoro-16&alpha;-methylprednisolone) is a synthetic corticosteroid that binds to glucocorticoid receptors [@doi:10.1021/cr068203e; @url:https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/dexamethasone].
It functions as an anti-inflammatory agent by binding to glucocorticoid receptors with higher affinity than endogenous cortisol [@doi:10.1016/B978-0-323-48110-6.00034-X].
Dexamethasone and other steroids are widely available and affordable, and they are often used to treat community-acquired pneumonia [@doi:10.1038/s41392-020-0127-9] as well as chronic inflammatory conditions such as asthma, allergies, and rheumatoid arthritis [@doi:10.1021/ja01545a061; @doi:10.1001/jama.1960.03030070009002; @dailymed-dexamethasone].
Immunosuppressive drugs such as steroids are typically contraindicated in the setting of infection [@doi:10.1177/2040622313485275], but because COVID-19 results in hyperinflammation that appears to contribute to mortality via lung damage, immunosuppression may be a helpful approach to treatment [@doi:10/ggnzmc].
A clinical trial that began in 2012 recently reported that dexamethasone may improve outcomes for patients with ARDS [@doi:10/ggpxzc], but a meta-analysis of a small amount of available data about dexamethasone as a treatment for SARS suggested that it may, in fact, be associated with patient harm [@doi:10/ggks86].
However, the findings in SARS may have been biased by the fact that all of the studies examined were observational and a large number of inconclusive studies were not included [@doi:10/ggq356].
The questions of whether and when to counter hyperinflammation with immunosuppression in the setting of COVID-19 (as in SARS [@doi:10.1186/cc2452]) was an area of intense debate, as the risks of inhibiting antiviral immunity needed to be weighed against the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects [@doi:10/ggq8hs].
As a result, guidelines early in the pandemic typically recommended avoiding treating COVID-19 patients with corticosteroids such as dexamethasone [@doi:10/ggks86].

Despite this initial concern, dexamethasone was evaluated as a potential treatment for COVID-19 (Appendix A).
Dexamethasone treatment comprised one arm of the multi-site Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial in the United Kingdom [@doi:10.1101/2020.06.22.20137273].
This study found that the 28-day mortality rate was lower in patients receiving dexamethasone than in those receiving standard of care (SOC).
However, this finding was driven by differences in mortality among patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation or supplementary oxygen at the start of the study.
The report indicated that dexamethasone reduced 28-day mortality relative to SOC in patients who were ventilated (29.3% versus 41.4%) and among those who were receiving oxygen supplementation (23.3% versus 26.2%) at randomization, but not in patients who were breathing independently (17.8% versus 14.0%).
These findings also suggested that dexamethasone may have reduced progression to mechanical ventilation, especially among patients who were receiving oxygen support at randomization.
Other analyses have supported the importance of disease course in determining the efficacy of dexamethasone: additional results suggest greater potential for patients who have experienced symptoms for at least seven days and patients who were not breathing independently [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2021436].
A meta-analysis that evaluated the results of the RECOVERY trial alongside trials of other corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone, similarly concluded that corticosteroids may be beneficial to patients with severe COVID-19 who are receiving oxygen supplementation [@doi:10.1053/j.jvca.2020.11.057].
Thus, it seems likely that dexamethasone is useful for treating inflammation associated with immunopathy or cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is a condition caused by detrimental overactivation of the immune system [@individual-pathogenesis].
In fact, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone are sometimes used to treat CRS [@doi:10.1182/blood-2014-05-552729].
Guidelines were quickly updated to encourage the use of dexamethasone in severe cases [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.16747], and this affordable and widely available treatment rapidly became a valuable tool against COVID-19 [@doi:10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173854], with demand surging within days of the preprint's release [@doi:10.1136/bmj.m2512].

### Approaches Targeting the Virus

Therapeutics that directly target the virus itself hold the potential to prevent people infected with SARS-CoV-2 from developing potentially damaging symptoms (Figure @fig:therapeutics).
Such drugs typically fall into the broad category of antivirals.
Antiviral therapies hinder the spread of a virus within the host, rather than destroying existing copies of the virus, and these drugs can vary in their specificity to a narrow or broad range of viral targets.
This process requires inhibiting the replication cycle of a virus by disrupting one of six fundamental steps [@isbn:978-1405136457].
In the first of these steps, the virus attaches to and enters the host cell through endocytosis.
Then the virus undergoes uncoating, which is classically defined as the release of viral contents into the host cell.
Next, the viral genetic material enters the nucleus where it gets replicated during the biosynthesis stage.
During the assembly stage, viral proteins are translated, allowing new viral particles to be assembled.
In the final step new viruses are released into the extracellular environment.
Although antivirals are designed to target a virus, they can also impact other processes in the host and may have unintended effects.
Therefore, these therapeutics must be evaluated for both efficacy and safety.
As the technology to respond to emerging viral threats has also evolved over the past two decades, a number of candidate treatments have been identified for prior viruses that may be relevant to the treatment of COVID-19.

![
**Mechanisms of Action for Potential Therapeutics**
Potential therapeutics currently being studied can target the SARS-CoV-2 virus or modify the host environment through many different mechanisms.
Here, the relationships between the virus, host cells, and several therapeutics are visualized.
Drug names are color-coded according to the grade assigned to them by the Center for Cytokine Storm Treatment & Laboratory's CORONA Project [@url:https://cdcn.org/corona-data-viewer] (Green = A, Lime = B, Orange = C, and Red = D).
](images/N001-LifeCyclePlusDrugs.png "SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and therapeutic mechanisms"){#fig:therapeutics secno=1}

Many antiviral drugs are designed to inhibit the replication of viral genetic material during the biosynthesis step.
Unlike DNA viruses, which can use the host enzymes to propagate themselves, RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 depend on their own polymerase, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), for replication [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7; @doi:10.1002/jmv.25761].
RdRP is therefore a potential target for antivirals against RNA viruses. 
Disruption of RdRP is the proposed mechanism underlying the treatment of SARS and MERS with ribavirin [@doi:10.1080/17460441.2019.1581171].
Ribavirin is an antiviral drug effective against other viral infections that was often used in combination with corticosteroids and sometimes interferon (IFN) medications to treat SARS and MERS [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
However, analyses of its effects in retrospective and _in vitro_ analyses of SARS and the SARS-CoV-1 virus, respectively, have been inconclusive [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
While IFNs and ribavirin have shown promise in _in vitro_ analyses of MERS, their clinical effectiveness remains unknown [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
The current COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity to assess the clinical effects of these treatments.
As one example, ribivarin was also used in the early days of COVID-19, but a retrospective cohort study comparing patients who did and did not receive ribivarin revealed no effect on the mortality rate [@doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106114].

Since nucleotides and nucleosides are the natural building blocks for RNA synthesis, an alternative approach has been to explore nucleoside and nucleotide analogs for their potential to inhibit viral replication.
Analogs containing modifications to nucleotides or nucleosides can disrupt key processes including replication [@doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.04.004].
A single incorporation does not influence RNA transcription; however, multiple events of incorporation lead to the arrest of RNA synthesis [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0068347].
One candidate antiviral considered for the treatment of COVID-19 is favipiravir (Avigan), also known as T-705, which was discovered by Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd. [@url:https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB12466].
It was previously found to be effective at blocking viral amplification in several influenza subtypes as well as other RNA viruses, such as _Flaviviridae_ and _Picornaviridae_, through a reduction in plaque formation [@doi:10.1128/AAC.46.4.977-981.2002] and viral replication in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells [@doi:10.1128/AAC.01051-06].
Favipiravir (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) acts as a purine and purine nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral RNA polymerase in a dose-dependent manner across a range of RNA viruses, including influenza viruses [@doi:10.1128/AAC.49.3.981-986.2005; @doi:10.1128/AAC.01074-08; @doi:10.1128/AAC.00356-07; @doi:10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.034; @doi:10.1128/AAC.01219-10].
Biochemical experiments showed that favipiravir was recognized as a purine nucleoside analogue and incorporated into the viral RNA template.
In 2014, the drug was approved in Japan for the treatment of influenza that was resistant to conventional treatments like neuraminidase inhibitors [@doi:10.2183/pjab.93.027].
Though initial analyses of favipiravir in observational studies of its effects on COVID-19 patients were promising, recent results of two small randomized controlled trials suggest that it is unlikely to affect COVID-19 outcomes (Appendix A).

In contrast, another nucleoside analog, remdesivir, is one of the few treatments against COVID-19 that has received FDA approval.
Remdesivir (GS-5734) is an intravenous antiviral that was proposed by Gilead Sciences as a possible treatment for Ebola virus disease.
It is metabolized to GS-441524, an adenosine analog that inhibits a broad range of polymerases and then evades exonuclease repair, causing chain termination [@doi:10.1074/jbc.AC120.013056; @doi:10.1128/mBio.00221-18; @doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].
Gilead received an emergency use authorization (EUA) for remdesivir from the FDA early in the pandemic (May 2020) and was later found to reduce mortality and recovery time in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial performed at 60 trial sites, 45 of which were in the United States [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2007764; @clinicaltrials:NCT04280705; @clinicaltrials:NCT04292899; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2007016].
<!-- The references above are confusing.  The same trials are cited in the list of two early trials and the later trials. -->
Subsequently, the WHO Solidarity trial, a large-scale, open-label trial enrolling 11,330 adult in-patients at 405 hospitals in 30 countries around the world, reported no effect of remdesivir on in-hospital mortality, duration of hospitalization, or progression to mechanical ventilation [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2023184].
Therefore, additional clinical trials of remdesivir in different patient pools and in combination with other therapies may be needed to refine its use in the clinic and determine the forces driving these differing results.
Remdesivir offers proof of principle that SARS-CoV-2 can be targeted at the level of viral replication, since remdesivir targets the viral RNA polymerase at high potency.
Identification of such candidates depends on knowledge about the virological properties of a novel threat.
However, the success and relative lack of success, respectively, of remdesivir and favipiravir underscore the fact that drugs with similar mechanisms will not always produce similar results in clinical trials.

### Disrupting Host-Virus Interactions

#### Interrupting Viral Colonization of Cells

Some of the most widely publicized examples of efforts to repurpose drugs for COVID-19 are broad-spectrum, small-molecule drugs where the mechanism of action made it seem that the drug might disrupt interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human host cells (Figure @fig:therapeutics).
However, the exact outcomes of such treatments are difficult to predict _a priori_, and there are several examples where early enthusiasm was not borne out in subsequent trials.
One of the most famous examples of an analysis of whether a well-known medication could provide benefits to COVID-19 patients came from the assessment of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which are used for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria as well as the treatment of lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis in adults [@dailymed-hcq].
These drugs are lysosomotropic agents, meaning they are weak bases that can pass through the plasma membrane.
It was thought that they might provide benefits against SARS-CoV-2 by interfering with the digestion of antigens within the lysosome and inhibiting CD4 T-cell stimulation while promoting the stimulation of CD8 T-cells [@doi:10.1111/j.1529-8019.2007.00131.x].
These compounds also have anti-inflammatory properties [@doi:10.1111/j.1529-8019.2007.00131.x] and can decrease the production of certain key cytokines involved in the immune response, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and inhibit the stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and TLR signaling [@doi:10.1111/j.1529-8019.2007.00131.x].

_In vitro_ analyses reported that CQ inhibited cell entry of SARS-CoV-1 [@doi:10.1186/1743-422X-2-69] and that both CQ and HCQ inhibited viral replication within cultured cells [@doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa237], leading to early hope that it might provide similar therapeutic or protective effects in patients.
However, while the first publication on the clinical application of these compounds to the inpatient treatment of COVID-19 was very positive [@doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949], it was quickly discredited [@url:https://www.isac.world/news-and-publications/official-isac-statement].
Over the following months, extensive evidence emerged demonstrating that CQ and HCQ offered no benefits for COVID-19 patients and, in fact, carried the risk of dangerous side effects (Appendix A).
The nail in the coffin came when findings from the large-scale RECOVERY trial were released on October 8, 2020.
This study enrolled 11,197 hospitalized patients whose physicians believed it would not harm them to participate and used a randomized, open-label design to study the effects of HCQ compared to standard of care (SOC) at 176 hospitals in the United Kingdom [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2022926].
Rates of COVID-19-related mortality did not differ between the control and HCQ arms, but patients receiving HCQ were slightly more likely to die due to cardiac events.
Patients who received HCQ also had a longer duration of hospitalization than patients receiving usual care and were more likely to progress to mechanical ventilation or death (as a combined outcome).
As a result, enrollment in the HCQ arm of the RECOVERY trial was terminated early [@url:https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/statement-from-the-chief-investigators-of-the-randomised-evaluation-of-covid-19-therapy-recovery-trial-on-hydroxychloroquine-5-june-2020-no-clinical-benefit-from-use-of-hydroxychloroquine-in-hospitalised-patients-with-covid-19].
The story of CQ/HCQ therefore illustrates how initial promising _in vitro_ analyses can fail to translate to clinical usefulness.

While CQ/HCQ are well-known medications that have long been prescribed in certain contexts, investigation of another well-established type of pharmaceutical was facilitated by the fact that it was already being taken by a large number of COVID-19 patients.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are among today's most commonly prescribed medications, often being used to control blood pressure [@url:https://clincalc.com/DrugStats/Drugs/Lisinopril; @doi:10.1056/NEJMp1901657].
In the United States, for example, they are prescribed well over 100,000,000 times annually [@doi:10.18553/jmcp.2010.16.9.671].
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the relationship between ACE2, ACEIs, and SARS had been considered as possible evidence that ACE2 could serve as a therapeutic target [@doi:10.1016/j.tips.2004.04.001], and the connection had been explored through _in vitro_ and molecular docking analysis [@doi:10.1161/01.HYP.0000146120.29648.36] but ultimately was not pursued clinically [@doi:10/d85vmw].
Data from some animal models suggest that several, but not all, ACEIs and several ARBs increase ACE2 expression in the cells of some organs [@doi:10.1093/cvr/cvaa097], but clinical studies have not established whether plasma ACE2 expression is increased in humans treated with these medications [@doi:10.1093/europace/euw246].
In this case, rather than introducing ARBs/ACEIs, a number of analyses have investigated whether discontinuing use affects COVID-19 outcomes.
An initial observational study of the association of exposure to ACEIs or ARBs with outcomes in COVID-19 was retracted from the _New England Journal of Medicine_ [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2007621] due to concerns related to data availability [@doi:10.1056/nejmc2021225].
As randomized trials have become available, they have demonstrated no effect of continuing versus discontinuing ARBs/ACEIs on patient outcomes [@doi:10/fvgt; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.25864] (Appendix A).
Thus, once again, despite a potential mechanistic association with the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these medications were not found to influence the trajectory of COVID-19 illness.

For medications that are widely known and common, clinical research into their efficacy against a novel threat can be developed very quickly.
This feasibility can present a double-edged sword.
For example, HCQ and CQ were incorporated into SOC in many countries early in the pandemic and had to be discontinued once their potential to harm COVID-19 patients became apparent [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/138946/download; @url:https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-chloroquine-hydroxychloroquine-only-be-used-clinical-trials-emergency-use-programmes].
Dexamethasone remains the major success story from this category of repurposed drugs and is likely to have saved a large number of lives since summer 2020 [@doi:10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.173854].

#### Manipulating the Host Immune Response

Treatments based on understanding a virus and/or how a virus interacts with the human immune system can fall into two categories: they can interact with the innate immune response, which is likely to be a similar response across viruses, or they can be specifically designed to imitate the adaptive immune response to a particular virus. 
In the latter case, conservation of structure or behavior across viruses enables exploring whether drugs developed for one virus can treat another.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of candidate therapeutics have been explored in these categories, with varied success.

Knowledge gained from trying to understand SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV from a fundamental biological perspective and characterize how they interact with the human immune system provides a theoretical basis for identifying candidate therapies.
Biologics are a particularly important class of drugs for efforts to address HCoV through this paradigm.
They are produced from components of living organisms or viruses, historically primarily from animal tissues, but have become increasingly feasible to produce as recombinant technologies have advanced  [@doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2009.10.006].
Biologics have become increasingly feasible to produce as recombinant DNA technologies have advanced [@doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2009.10.006].

There are many differences on the development side between biologics and synthesized pharmaceuticals, such as small molecule drugs.
Typically, biologics are orders of magnitude larger than small molecule drugs and are catabolized by the body to their amino acid components [@doi:10.2174/138920006774832604].
They are often heat sensitive, and their toxicity can vary, as it is not directly associated with the primary effects of the drug; in general, their physiochemical properties are much less understood compared to small molecules [@doi:10.2174/138920006774832604].
Biologics include significant medical breakthroughs such as insulin for the management of diabetes and vaccines, as well monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and interferons (IFNs), which can be used to target the host immune response after infection.

mAbs have revolutionized the way we treat human diseases and have become some of the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market in recent years [@doi:10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z].
There are currently 79 FDA approved mAbs on the market, including antibodies for viral infections (e.g. Ibalizumab for _Human immunodeficiency virus_ and Palivizumab for _Respiratory syncytial virus_) [@doi:10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z; @doi:10.1146/annurev-immunol-032712-095916].
Virus-specific neutralizing antibodies commonly target viral surface glycoproteins or host structures, thereby inhibiting viral entry through receptor binding interference [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2017.02323; @doi:10.1080/21645515.2017.1337614].
This interference is predicted to reduce the viral load, mitigate disease, and reduce overall hospitalization.
mAbs can be designed for a particular virus, and significant advances have been made in the speed at which new mAbs can be identified and produced.
At the time of the SARS and MERS epidemics, interest in mAbs to reduce infection was never realized [@doi:10.1093/infdis/jiw080; @doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.03.025], but this allowed for mAbs to quickly be considered among the top candidates against COVID-19.

##### Biologics and the Innate Immune Response

Deaths from COVID-19 often occur when inflammation becomes dysregulated following an immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Therefore, one potential approach to reducing COVID-19 mortality rates is to manage the inflammatory response in severely ill patients.
One candidate therapeutic identified that uses this mechanism is tocilizumab (TCZ).
TCZ is a mAb that was developed to manage chronic inflammation caused by the continuous synthesis of the cytokine IL-6 [@doi:10.1101/cshperspect.a016295].
IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the interleukin family, which is comprised by immune system regulators that are primarily responsible for immune cell differentiation.
Often used to treat chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis [@doi:10.1101/cshperspect.a016295], TCZ has become a pharmaceutical of interest for the treatment of COVID-19 because of the role IL-6 plays in this disease.
It has also been approved to treat CRS caused by CAR-T treatments [@dailymed-tocilizumab].
While the secretion of IL-6 can be associated with chronic conditions, IL-6 is a key player in the innate immune response and is secreted by macrophages in response to the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns [@doi:10.1101/cshperspect.a016295].
An analysis of 191 in-patients at two Wuhan hospitals revealed that blood concentrations of IL-6 differed between patients who did and did not recover from COVID-19.
Patients who ultimately died had higher IL-6 levels at admission than those who recovered [@doi:10/ggnxb3].
Additionally, IL-6 levels remained higher throughout the course of hospitalization in the patients who ultimately died [@doi:10/ggnxb3].

Currently, TCZ is being administered either as an intervention or as concomitant medication in {{ebm_tocilizumab_ct}} interventional COVID-19 clinical trials (Figure @fig:ebm-trials).
A number of retrospective studies have been conducted in several countries [@doi:10/d2pk; @doi:10.1016/j.chest.2020.06.006; @doi:10.1016/j.ejim.2020.05.009; @doi:10.1016/j.medmal.2020.05.001; @doi:10.1093/qjmed/hcaa206; @doi:10.1073/pnas.2005615117].
In general, these studies have reported a positive effect of TCZ on reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients, although due to their retrospective designs, significant limitations are present in all of them (Appendix A).
It was not until February 11, 2021 that a preprint describing preliminary results of the first randomized controlled trial of TCZ was released as part of the RECOVERY trial [@doi:10.1101/2021.02.11.21249258].
TCZ was found to reduce 28-day mortality from 33% in patients receiving SOC alone to 29% in those receiving TCZ.
Combined analysis of the RECOVERY trial data with data from smaller randomized controlled trials suggested a 13% reduction in 28-day mortality [@doi:10.1101/2021.02.11.21249258].
While this initial report did not include the full results expected from the RECOVERY trial, this large-scale, randomized controlled trial provides strong evidence that TCZ may offer benefits for COVID-19 patients.
The RECOVERY trial along with results from several other RCTs [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2028700; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2030340; @clinicaltrials:NCT04409262; @clinicaltrials:NCT04320615; @clinicaltrials:NCT04372186] were cited as support for the EUA issued for TCZ in June 2021 [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/150319/download].
However, the fact that TCZ suppresses the immune response means that it does carry risks for patients, especially a potential risk of secondary infection (Appendix A).

TCZ is just one example of a candidate drug targeting the host immune response and specifically excessive inflammation.
For example, interferons (IFNs) have also been investigated; these are a family of cytokines critical to activating the innate immune response against viral infections.
Synairgen has been investigating a candidate drug, SNG001, which is an IFN-𝛽-1a formulation to be delivered to the lungs via inhalation [@clinicaltrials:NCT04385095] that they reported reduced progression to ventilation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study of 101 patients with an average age in the late 50s [@synairgen-SNG001-July-2020; @doi:10/ghjzm4].
However, these findings were not supported by the large-scale WHO Solidarity trial, which reported no significant effect of IFN-&beta;-1a on patient survival during hospitalization [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2023184], although differences in the designs of the two studies, and specifically the severity of illness among enrolled patients, may have influenced their divergent outcomes (Appendix A).
Other biologics influencing inflammation are also being explored (Appendix A).
It is also important that studies focused on inflammation as a possible therapeutic target consider the potential differences in baseline inflammation among patients from different backgrounds, which may be caused by differing life experiences (see [@individual-inequality]).

##### Biologics and the Adaptive Immune Response

While TCZ is an example of an mAb focused on managing the innate immune response, other treatments are more specific, targeting the adaptive immune response after an infection.
In some cases, treatments can utilize biologics obtained directly from recovered individuals.
From the very early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, polyclonal antibodies from convalescent plasma were investigated as a potential treatment for COVID-19 [@doi:10/ggqr7s; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.4940].
Convalescent plasma was used in prior epidemics including SARS, Ebola Virus Disease, and even the 1918 Spanish Influenza [@doi:10/ggqr7s; @doi:10.1002/jmv.25961].
Use of convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT) over more than a century has aimed to reduce symptoms and improve mortality in infected people [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25961], possibly by accelerating viral clearance [@doi:10/ggqr7s].
However, it seems unlikely that this classic treatment confers any benefit for COVID-19 patients.
Several systematic reviews have investigated whether CPT reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients, and although findings from early in the pandemic (up to April 19, 2020) did support use of CPT [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25961], the tide has shifted as the body of available literature has grown [@doi:10.1001/jama.2021.2747].
While titer levels were suggested as a possible determining factor in the success of CPT against COVID-19 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2031893], the large-scale RECOVERY trial evaluated the effect of administering high-titer plasma specifically and found no effect on mortality or hospital discharge over a 28-day period [@doi:10.1101/2021.03.09.21252736].
These results thus suggest that, despite initial optimism and an EUA from the FDA, CPT is unlikely to be an effective therapeutic for COVID-19.

A different narrative is shaping up around the use of mAbs specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2. 
During the first SARS epidemic in 2002, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were found in SARS-CoV-1-infected patients [@doi:10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.01009.x; @doi:10.1086/423286].
Several studies following up on these findings identified various S-glycoprotein epitopes as the major targets of nAbs against SARS-CoV-1 [@doi:10.1517/14712590902763755].
Coronaviruses use trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins on their surface to bind to the host cell, allowing for cell entry [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058].
Each S glycoprotein protomer is comprised of an S1 domain, also called the receptor binding domain (RBD), and an S2 domain.
The S1 domain binds to the host cell while the S2 domain facilitates the fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes [@doi:10.1517/14712590902763755].
The genomic identity between the RBD of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 is around 74% [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.16.951723].
Due to this high degree of similarity, preexisting antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 were initially considered candidates for neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2.
While some antibodies developed against the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein showed cross-neutralization activity with SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1016/j.tips.2020.07.004; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2349-y], others failed to bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at relevant concentrations [@doi:10.1126/science.abb2507].
Cross-neutralizing activities were dependent on whether the epitope recognized by the antibodies were conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1016/j.tips.2020.07.004].

Technological advances in antibody drug design as well as in structural biology massively accelerated the discovery of novel antibody candidates and the mechanisms by which they interact with the target structure.
Within just a year of the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein being published, an impressive pipeline of monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 entered clinical trials, with hundreds more candidates in preclinical stages.
The first human monoclonal neutralizing antibody specifically against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein was developed using hybridoma technology [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.11.987958], where antibody-producing B-cells developed by mice are inserted into myeloma cells to produce a hybrid cell line (the hybridoma) that is grown in culture.
The 47D11 antibody clone was able to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.
This antibody (now ABVV-47D11) has recently entered clinical trials in collaboration with AbbVie.
Additionally, an extensive monoclonal neutralizing antibody pipeline has been developed to combat the ongoing pandemic, with over 50 different antibodies in clinical trials [@doi:10.1016/j.bsheal.2021.02.001].
Thus far, the mAb sotrovimab as well as two antibody cocktails (bamlanivimab/estesevimab and casirivimab/imdevimab) have been granted EUA emergency use authorization by the FDA. <!---Note that there doesn’t seem to be anything about strovimab. If it's more recent than the others, maybe we can note that. I also changed the cocktails to include the generic drug names we use below, so it's easier to follow.-->

One of the studied antibody cocktails consists of bamlanivimab and estesevimab.
Bamlanivimab (Ly-CoV555) is a human mAb that was derived from convalescent plasma donated by a recovered COVID-19 patient, evaluated in research by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and subsequently developed by AbCellera and Eli Lilly.
The neutralizing activity of bamlanivimab was initially demonstrated _in vivo_ using a nonhuman primate model [@doi:10.1101/2020.09.30.318972].
Based on these positive preclinical data, Eli Lilly initiated the first human clinical trial for a monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2.
The phase 1 trial, which was conducted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, was completed in August 2020 [@clinicaltrials:NCT04411628].
Estesevimab (LY-CoV016 or JS-016) is also a monoclonal neutralizing antibody against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.
It was initially developed by Junshi Biosciences and later licensed and developed through Eli Lilly.
A phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety of etesevimab was completed in October 2020 [@clinicaltrials:NCT04441931].
Etesevimab was shown to bind a different epitope on the spike protein than bamlanivimab, suggesting that the two antibodies used as a combination therapy would further enhance their clinical use compared to a monotherapy [@doi:10.1001/jama.2021.0202].
To assess the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab alone or in combination with etesevimab for the treatment of COVID-19, a phase 2/3 trial (BLAZE-1) [@clinicaltrials:NCT04427501] was initiated.
The interim analysis of the phase 2 portion suggested that bamlanivimab alone was able to accelerate the reduction in viral load [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2029849].
However, more recent data suggests that only the bamlanivimab/etesevimab combination therapy is able to reduce viral load in COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.1001/jama.2021.0202].
Based on this data, the combination therapy received an EUA for COVID-19 from the FDA in February 2021 [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/145801/download].

A second therapy is comprised of casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-COV2).
Casirivimab (REGN10933) and imdevimab (REGN10987) are two monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
They were both developed by Regeneron in a parallel high-throughput screen to identify neutralizing antibodies from either humanized mice or patient-derived convalescent plasma [@doi:10.1126/science.abd0827].
In these efforts, multiple antibodies were characterized for their ability to bind and neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
The investigators hypothesized that an antibody cocktail, rather than each individual antibody, could increase the therapeutic efficacy while minimizing the risk for virus escape.
Therefore, the authors tested pairs of individual antibodies for their ability to simultaneously bind the RBD of the spike protein.
Based on this data, casirivimab and imdevimab were identified as the lead antibody pair, resulting in the initiation of two clinical trials [@clinicaltrials:NCT04426695; @clinicaltrials:NCT04425629].
Data from this phase 1-3 trial published in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ shows that the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail reduced viral load, particularly in patients with high viral load or whose endogenous immune response had not yet been initiated [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035002].
However, in patients who already initiated an immune response, exogenous addition of REGN-COV2 did not improve the endogenous immune response.
Both doses were well tolerated with no serious events related to the antibody cocktail.
Based on this data, the FDA granted an EUA for REGN-COV2 in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at risk of developing severe disease [@url:https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibodies-treatment-covid-19].
Ongoing efforts are trying to evaluate the efficacy of REGN-COV2 to improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients [@clinicaltrials:NCT04426695].

Several potential limitations remain in the application of mAbs to the treatment of COVID-19.
One of the biggest challenges is identifying antibodies that not only bind to their target, but also prove to be beneficial for disease management.
Currently, use of mAbs is limited to people with mild to moderate disease that are not hospitalized, and it has yet to be determined whether they can be used as a successful treatment option for severe COVID-19 patients.
While preventing people from developing severe illness provides significant benefits, patients with severe illness are at the greatest risk of death, and therefore therapeutics that provide benefits against severe illness are particularly desirable.
It remains to be seen whether mAbs confer any benefits for patients in this category.

Another concern about therapeutics designed to amplify the response to a specific viral target is that they may need to be modified as the virus evolves.
With the ongoing global spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, there is a growing concern that mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could escape antibody neutralization, thereby reducing the efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapeutics and vaccines.
A comprehensive mutagenesis screen recently identified several amino acid substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that can prevent antibody neutralization [@doi:10.1016/j.chom.2021.01.014].
While some mutations result in resistance to only one antibody, others confer broad resistance to multiple mAbs as well as polyclonal human sera, suggesting that some amino acids are “hotspots” for antibody resistance.
However, it was not investigated whether the resistance mutations identified result in a fitness advantage.
Accordingly, an impact on neutralizing efficiency has been reported for the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant first identified in the UK and the B.1.351 (Beta) variant first identified in in South Africa [@doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-228079/v1; @doi:10.1101/2021.02.03.429355; @doi:10.1101/2021.01.25.428137].
As of June 25, 2021, the CDC recommended a pause in the use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab due to decreased efficacy against the P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.351 (Beta) variants of SARS-CoV-2 [@url:https://www.phe.gov/emergency/events/COVID19/investigation-MCM/Bamlanivimab-etesevimab/Pages/bamlanivimab-etesevimab-distribution-pause.aspx].
While the reported impact on antibody neutralization needs to be confirmed _in vivo_, it suggests that some adjustments to therapeutic antibody treatments may be necessary to maintain the efficacy that was reported in previous clinical trials.

Several strategies have been employed to try to mitigate the risk of diminished antibody neutralization.
Antibody cocktails such as those already holding an EUA may help overcome the risk for attenuation of the neutralizing activity of a single monoclonal antibody.
These cocktails consist of antibodies that recognize different epitopes on the spike protein, decreasing the likelihood that a single amino acid change can cause resistance to all antibodies in the cocktail.
However, neutralizing resistance can emerge even against an antibody cocktail if the individual antibodies target subdominant epitopes [@doi:10.1101/2021.02.03.429355].
Another strategy is to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies that target structures that are highly conserved, as these are less likely to mutate [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2007.11.018; @doi:10.1126/science.1171491] or to target epitopes that are insensitive to mutations [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.04.054].
One such antibody (ADG-2) has recently been reported [@doi:10.1126/science.abf4830].
This antibody targets a highly conserved epitope that overlaps the hACE2 binding site of all clade 1 sarbecoviruses.
Prophylactic administration of ADG-2 in an immunocompetent mouse model of COVID-19 resulted in protection against viral replication in the lungs and respiratory burden.
Since the epitope targeted by ADG-2 represents an Achilles’ heel for clade 1 sarbecoviruses, this antibody might be a promising candidate against all circulating variants as well as emerging SARS-related coronaviruses.

The development of mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 has made it clear that this technology is rapidly adaptable and offers great potential for the response to emerging viral threats.
However, additional investigation may be needed to adapt mAb treatments to SARS-CoV-2 as it evolves and potentially to pursue designs that confer benefits for patients at the greatest risk of death.
While polyclonal antibodies from convalescent plasma have been evaluated as a treatment for COVID-19, these studies have suggested fewer potential benefits against SARS-CoV-2 than mAbs; convalescent plasma therapy has been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere [@doi:10/ggqr7s; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.4940].
Thus, advances in biologics for COVID-19 illustrate that an understanding of how the host and virus interact can guide therapeutic approaches.
The FDA authorization of two combination mAb therapies, in particular, underscores the potential for this strategy to allow for a rapid response to a novel pathogen.
Additionally, while TCZ is not yet as established, this therapy suggests that the strategy of using biologics to counteract the cytokine storm response may provide therapies for the highest-risk patients.

### Computational Design and Identification of Therapeutics

As illustrated by the difference in the current status of remdesivir and favipiravir as treatments for COVID-19, identifying specific compounds that will produce a desired interaction with a virus is challenging.
Additionally, because the drug development process is slow and costly and the development of compounds specifically targeted to an emerging viral threat are not a practical solution in the short term, efforts to screen existing drug compounds for alternative indications have become popular [@doi:10.1016/j.drudis.2019.06.014; @doi:10.1111/bph.13895].
While some efforts to screen for potential repurposing opportunities are experimental, others use high-throughput computational approaches [@doi:10.1016/j.drudis.2019.06.014; @doi:10.1016/j.tim.2018.04.004].
For infectious viral diseases, several strategies can be employed: identifying drugs that interact with a target that is shared between a novel and known viral pathogen, identifying drugs that interact with a target that is shared between a novel viral pathogen and another illness (i.e., a cancer drug with antiviral potential), and identifying a drug that might interact with additional molecular targets beyond those it was developed for [@doi:10.1016/j.tim.2018.04.004].
While preclinical and clinical tests ultimately reveal whether the intended effect is achieved, selection of an appropriate target is fundamental to success in repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.168].
Computational drug repurposing screens are able to take advantage of big data in biology [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.168] and as a result are much more feasible today than during the height of the SARS and MERS outbreaks in the early 2000s and early 2010s, respectively.
While both small molecules and biologics can be candidates for repurposing, the significantly lower price of many small molecule drugs means that they are typically more appealing candidates [@doi:10.1089/adt.2019.950].

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, computational efforts to screen or produce compounds have been applied to a few different challenges.
One built on the same concept as the antivirals described above: several studies have shown that viral proteases play an important role in the life cycle of viruses, including coronaviruses, by modulating the cleavage of viral polyprotein precursors [@doi:10.2174/138161207780162971].
Serine protease inhibitors were previously suggested for the treatment of SARS and MERS viruses [@doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011].
Recently, a study [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052] suggested that camostat mesylate, a protease inhibitor, could block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into lung cells _in vitro_.
Computer-aided design allowed for the development of a Michael acceptor inhibitor, now known as N3, to target a protease critical to SARS-CoV-2 replication.
<!-- Which study was the one that actually computationally designed N3? -->
Discovery of the N3 mechanism arose from interest in the two polyproteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase gene, pp1a and pp1ab, that are critical for viral replication and transcription [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y].
These polyproteins must undergo proteolytic processing.
This processing is usually conducted by Mpro, a 33.8-kDa SARS-CoV-2 protease that is therefore fundamental to viral replication and transcription.
N3 was designed computationally [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0030324] to bind in the substrate binding pocket of the Mpro protease of SARS-like coronaviruses [@doi:10.1007/s13238-013-2841-3], therefore inhibiting proteolytic processing.
Subsequently, the structure of N3-bound SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was solved [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y], confirming the computational prediction.
N3 was tested _in vitro_ on SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells, which belong to a line of cells established from the kidney epithelial cells of an African green monkey, and was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y].
After the design and confirmation of N3 as a highly potent Michael acceptor inhibitor and the identification of Mpro's structure [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y; @doi:10.1126/science.abb3405], 10,000 compounds were screened for their _in vitro_ anti-Mpro activity.
Six leads were identified, and _in vitro_ analysis revealed that ebselen, an organoselenium compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [@doi:10.1007/s11033-014-3417-x], had the strongest potency in reducing the viral load in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y].
Ebselen is an organoselenium compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [@doi:10.1007/s11033-014-3417-x]; however, it is likely to be a promiscuous binder, which could diminish its therapeutic potential [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y].
While there is clear computational and _in vitro_ support for ebselen's potential as a COVID-19 therapeutic, results from clinical trials are not yet available for this compound.
In July 2020 phase II clinical trials commenced to assess the effects of SPI-1005, an investigational drug from Sound Pharmaceuticals that contains ebselen [@url:https://www.contractpharma.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2020-08-31/fda-clears-spis-ebselen-for-phase-ii-covid-19-trials], on 60 adults presenting with each of moderate [@clinicaltrials:NCT04484025] and severe [@clinicaltrials:NCT04483973] COVID-19.

Other candidates have emerged from a broader assessment of work in computational prediction of candidate drugs for repurposing against COVID-19.
A large number of efforts have sought to collect data about interactions between drugs and SARS-CoV-2 and about the genomic response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
These resources were integrated into the COVID-19 Drug and Gene Set Library, which at the time of its publication contained 1,620 drugs sourced from 173 experimental and computational drug sets and 18,676 human genes sourced from 444 gene sets [@doi:10.1016/j.patter.2020.100090].
This study found that several drugs had been identified as candidates across multiple independent analyses, including several that had received significant attention as potential therapeutics for COVID-19 (e.g., CQ/HCQ and remdesivir) [@doi:10.1016/j.patter.2020.100090].
A second study expanded on these results by identifying that cationic amphiphilicity was a shared property among many of the candidate drugs identified through both computational and phenotypic screens, suggesting it as a potential cause of a compound's proposed antiviral activity [@doi:10.1126/science.abi4708].
Antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 _in vitro_ was correlated with phospholipidosis for drugs with and without cationic amphiphilicity.
Cationic amphiphilic drugs are known to initiate phospholipidosis, which is when phospholipids accumulate in the lysosome [@doi:10.1515/hsz-2019-0270].
Mechanistically, phospholipidosis could disrupt viral replication by inhibiting lipid processing [@doi:10.1080/01913123.2020.1850966] (see discussion of HCQ in Appendix A).
This observation would be consistent with preliminary evidence that certain psychotropic drugs may be protective against COVID-19 [@doi:10.1016/j.drudis.2020.06.022; @doi:10.1007/s00406-020-01231-x; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.22760].
However, phospholipidosis-inducing drugs were not effective at preventing viral propagation _in vivo_ in a murine model of COVID-19 [@doi:10.1126/science.abi4708].
Therefore, removing hits that induce phospholipidosis from computational and _in vitro_ experimental repurposing screens (e.g., [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2021.108959]) may help emphasize those that are more likely to provide clinical benefits.

### Considerations in Balancing Different Approaches

The many approaches described here offer a variety of advantages and limitations in responding to a novel viral threat and building on existing bodies of knowledge in different ways.
A host-oriented, symptom management approach allows clinicians to apply experience with related diseases or related symptoms to organize a rapid response aimed at saving the lives of patients already infected with a new disease.
Oftentimes, the pharmaceutical agents that are applied are small-molecule, broad-spectrum pharmaceuticals that are widely available and affordable to produce, and they may already be available for other purposes, allowing clinicians to administer them to patients quickly either with an EUA or off-label.
However, the fact that the targets of these agents are non-specific means that the mechanism of action can appear to be relevant to COVID-19 without a therapeutic or prophylactic effect being observed in clinical trials.
Over the last year, dexamethasone has emerged as the strongest treatment against severe COVID-19, but other clinically suggested compounds such as HCQ/CQ and ARBs/ACEis have not borne out early hope in their mechanistic relevance.
A number of vaccine development programs have also met huge success using a range of strategies [@individual-vaccines].
Although only limited testing of candidate therapies was possible during the SARS and MERS epidemics, the scale and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic has offered the opportunity to test many hypothesized treatments.
The success of dexamethasone clearly illustrates how clinical context can be a valuable approach through which to identify candidate therapeutics.

Many efforts to repurpose drugs for COVID-19 have built on information gained through basic scientific research of HCoV.
Understanding how related viruses function has allowed researchers to identify possible pharmacological strategies to disrupt pathogenesis.
Relatedly, understanding host-pathogen interactions can offer additional opportunities to interrupt pathogenesis (Figure @fig:therapeutics).
Some of these compounds are small-molecule antivirals, which can be boutique and experimental medications like remdesivir.
Remdesivir has shown promise as an antiviral therapeutic, but other antivirals did not receive the same support from clinical trials and even remdesivir was not found to reduce mortality in the worldwide WHO Solidarity trial.
Other candidate drugs that intercept host-pathogen interactions include biologics, which imitate the function of endogenous host compounds.
Because the second phase of COVID-19 infection, associated with a severe inflammatory response, is typically the one presenting the greatest risk of death, inflammation-related therapeutics including TCZ have been explored based on the importance of IL-6 in the inflammatory response.
Once again, this approach does not require the development of compounds specifically designed for the emergent viral threat, but rather hinges on a theoretical understanding of how the virus interacts with a human host and how pharmaceuticals can be used to modify those interactions.
In contrast, other mAbs can be designed based on a specific pathogen.
COVID-19 has demonstrated that this development can progress rapidly, with two mAb cocktails currently approved in the United States.
<!-- Do we have any broad insights into the types of trials that have been run and the degree of clinical evidence they provide? It seems as if in several cases there were small initial trials (some observational or underpowered) that didn't provide strong evidence for or against a drug. We had to wait for RECOVERY, Solidarity, etc. results to draw better conclusions. Is that accurate or worth commenting on? -->

Finally, more recent computational approaches have begun to show potential in the age of big data.
Computational screening allows for a large number of compounds to be evaluated to identify those most likely to display a desired behavior or function.
This approach can involve modeling interactions between a compound and a virus rather than the experimental observation of their observed interactions.
In such cases, these compounds may lack some of the benefits of other categories; for example, computationally designed compounds typically lack safety information, whereas for more established therapeutics, a general understanding of the drug's safety in other contexts may be available prior to the beginning of clinical trials.
In other cases, however, computational analysis of large bodies of data has allowed researchers to identify candidates among known drugs.
As illustrated above, this approach may make it possible to find underlying characteristics that produce new hypotheses about the relationship between a host, a virus, and candidate pharmaceuticals.
As more data becomes available, such responses are likely to become increasingly feasible and powerful.
<!-- What is our overall sense of how valuable computational repurposing tools versus experimental screens of FDA-approved compounds has been? With many diseases, there may not be resources to experimentally test many drugs in vitro. Does the calculation change with a global pandemic when many labs are willing to test all approved compounds in vitro? I'm wondering what we would say about comments like https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/07/19/too-many-papers I'm pro-computational screening in general but am curious whether the benefits change in this specific setting. -->

The all-hands-on-deck approach that the scientific community has taken towards the COVID-19 pandemic has facilitated an unprecedented breadth of research into an emerging viral threat.
Experience gained through prior outbreaks of HCoVs combined with recent scientific advances in other fields has enabled the rapid assessment of candidate drugs using a number of different approaches.
The combination of these approaches in addition to the benefits provided by vaccines [@individual-vaccines] is likely to provide additional benefits beyond those apparent in trials of single drugs.
For example, traditionally, viral targets have been favored for pharmaceutical interventions because altering host processes is likely to be less specific than targeting the virus directly [@doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.03.020]; but on the other hand, targeting the host offers potential for a complementary strategy to antivirals that could broadly limit the ability of viruses to replicate [@doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.03.020].
As more clinical trials become available, greater insights into which drugs are particularly suited to COVID-19 will become more clear.
However, the current crisis has underscored how different areas of biomedical research working in concert can produce a multi-pronged approach to tackling an emergent viral threat.

Drug repurposing has shaped the conversation about treatments for COVID-19 over the first year and a half of the pandemic.
By now, several drugs are available for the treatment of COVID-19 (Table @tbl:summary-table).
These compounds are proposed to use a variety of mechanisms of action (Figure @fig:therapeutics).
Because the scale of the COVID-19 crisis has far exceeded that seen in prior HCoV epidemics, analyses of potential compounds has benefited from the plethora of opportunities to study the effectiveness of theoretically relevant pharmacological interventions.
As the results of more clinical trials become available, the treatment options may continue to evolve.
However, at present, it is clear that building on a wide range of available information in order to identify potential drugs for repurposing opens a variety of opportunities for identifying compounds of interest.
This research is likely to provide important information for targeted HCoVs and other emerging viral threats in the future.
