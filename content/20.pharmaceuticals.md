## Identification and Development of Therapeutics for COVID-19

### Introduction

The novel coronavirus _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2_ (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and quickly precipitated the worldwide spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
COVID-19 is associated with symptoms ranging from none (asymptomatic) to mild to severe, with approximately 2% of patients dying from COVID-19-related complications, such as acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) [@individual-pathogenesis].
The virus is likely spread between people primarily by droplets, with the role of contact and aerosol transmission still in question [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12458; @doi:10/gg6br7].
As a result, public health guidelines have been critical to efforts to control the spread of the virus.
However, as of early 2021, COVID-19 remains a significant worldwide concern (Figure @fig:csse-deaths), with cases in some places surging far above the numbers reported during the initial outbreak in early 2020.
Due to the continued threat of the virus and the severity of the disease, the identification and development of therapeutic interventions have emerged as significant international priorities.
Fortunately, prior developments during other recent pandemics, especially those caused by human coronaviruses (HCoV), have provided a number of hypotheses guiding a biomedical approach to the novel coronavirus infection.
However, previous emerging disease threats have been controlled much more quickly than SARS-CoV-2 through public health efforts (Figure @fig:csse-deaths), which has made the repurposing and development of pharmaceuticals uniquely important in the face of this crisis.

Previous emergent viral threats had a much lower death toll that was not felt on a such a global scale, and in most cases were controlled much more quickly.
For example, SARS-CoV-1 was controlled within 9 months of its appearance, whereas SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant global threat almost 1.5 years later.

#### Lessons from Prior HCoV Outbreaks

SARS-CoV-2's rapid shift from an unknown virus to a significant worldwide threat closely parallels the emergence of _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ (SARS-CoV-1).
The first documented case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China in November 2019, and the disease quickly spread worldwide during the early months of 2020.
The first case of SARS was reported in November 2002 in the Guangdong Province of China, and it spread within China and then into several countries across continents over the following months [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029; @doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
In fact, genome sequencing quickly revealed the virus causing COVID-19 to be a novel betacoronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-1 [@doi:10.46234/ccdcw2020.017].
While similarities between these two viruses are unsurprising given their close phylogenetic relationship, there are also some differences in how the viruses affect humans.
SARS-CoV-1 infection is severe, with an estimated death rate for SARS of 9.5% [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029], while estimates of the death rate associated with COVID-19 are much lower, at approximately 2% [@individual-pathogenesis].
SARS-CoV-1 is highly contagious via droplet transmission and has a basic reproduction number (R~0~) of 4 (i.e., each person infected was estimated to infect four other people) [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
SARS-CoV-2 also appears to be spread primarily by droplet transmission [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12458; @doi:10/gg6br7], and most estimates of its R~0~ fall between 2.5 and 3 [@individual-pathogenesis].
Therefore, SARS is thought to be a deadlier and more transmissible disease than COVID-19.

The 17-year difference in the timing of these two outbreaks led to some major differences in the tools available to the international community in organizing a response.
At the time that SARS-CoV-1 emerged, no new HCoV had been identified in almost 40 years [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
The identity of the virus underlying the SARS disease remained unknown until April of 2003, when the SARS-CoV-1 virus was characterized through a worldwide scientific effort spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO) [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was released on January 3, 2020 [@doi:10.46234/ccdcw2020.017], only days after the international community became aware of the novel pneumonia-like illness now known as COVID-19.
While SARS-CoV-1 belonged to a distinct lineage from the two other HCoVs known at the time of its discovery [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029], SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV-1 and a more distant relative of another HCoV characterized in 2012, _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ [@doi:10/ggjr43; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1211721].
During the 21st century, significant efforts has been devoted to characterizing these two devastating hCoV in order to better understand how they interact with human hosts.
Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 emerged under very different circumstances than SARS-CoV-1 in terms of scientific knowledge about HCoVs and the tools available to characterize them.

Despite the apparent advantages for responding to SARS-CoV-2, the trajectories of the pandemics associated with each of the viruses have also diverged significantly.
By July 2003, the SARS outbreak was officially determined to be under control, with the success credited to infection management practices such as mask wearing [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is still circulating and remains a concern; although the fatality rate is very high at almost 35%, the disease is much less easily transmitted, as its R~0~ has been estimated to be 1 [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
The low R~0~ in combination with public health practices allowed for its spread to be contained [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
Neither of these trajectories are comparable to that of SARS-CoV-2, which remains a serious threat worldwide almost a year and a half after the first cases of COVID-19 emerged.

### Potential Approaches to the Treatment of COVID-19

Today, many different approaches are available for identifying existing pharmaceuticals or candidate compounds that might be useful in mitigating the effects of a viral infection.
Therapeutics often utilize two potential avenues: reducing the symptoms that are harmful to patients or targeting the virus directly to hinder the spread of infection.
The goal of the former is to reduce the severity and risks of an active infection, while for the latter, it is to inhibit the replication of the virus once an individual is infected.
Two strategies are common for the identification of potential therapeutics against an emerging disease or a novel virus: drug repurposing and drug development.
Drug repurposing involves identifying an existing compound that may provide benefits in the context of interest [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.168].
This strategy can focus on either approved or investigational drugs, for which there may be applicable preclinical or safety information [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.168].
Drug development, on the other hand, provides an opportunity to identify or develop a compound specifically relevant to a particular need, but it is often a lengthy and expensive process characterized by repeated failure [@doi:10.1016/j.trci.2017.10.005].
Drug repurposing therefore tends to be emphasized in a situation like the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Even from the early months of the pandemic, a number of studies emerged investigating the potential effects of approved and investigational drugs.
These candidates were identified based on a broad understanding of coronavirus-host interactions largely gained from research in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.
The rapid timescale of this response meant that, initially, most evidence came from observational studies, which compare groups of patients who did and did not receive a treatment to determine whether it may have an effect.
These studies can be conducted rapidly but are subject to confounding.
In contrast, randomized controlled trials are the standard means of assessing the effects of medications.
In these studies, patients are prospectively and randomly assigned to treatment conditions, allowing for much stronger interpretations to be drawn; however, data from these trials takes much longer to collect.
Both sources have proven to be important sources of information to the development of a rapid response to the COVID-19 crisis, but as the pandemic draws on and more results become available from randomized controlled trials, more definitive answers are becoming available about proposed therapeutics.
A large number of interventional clinical trials are currently investigating or have investigated a large number of possible therapeutics and combinations of therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 (Figure @fig:ebm-trials).

The purpose of this review is to provide an evolving resource tracking the status of efforts to repurpose and develop drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. 
We highlight four responses that have all provide different paradigms for the identification of pharmaceutical treatments.  
As results become available from additional clinical trials, we will continue to update this manuscript to keep pace with the current understanding of which therapeutics may be effective against SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19.
 
### Clinical Responses to COVID-19

A variety of symptom profiles with a range of severity are associated with COVID-19, many of which are not life-threatening.
A study of COVID-19 patients in a hospital in Berlin, Germany found that the symptoms associated with the highest risk of death included infection-related symptoms, such as sepsis, respiratory symptoms such as ARDS, and cardiovascular failure or pulmonary embolism [@doi:10.1101/2020.06.15.20131540].
<!-- To Do: one-sentence mention of cytokine storm-->
Therapeutics that treat the most severe cases are therefore urgently needed, and identifying strategies for treating patients is a priority for clinicians.
In the case of SARS and MERS, <!--To Do: Steroids?-->
In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians sought to identify potential treatments that could benefit patients, and in some cases shared their experiences and advice on social media sites such as Twitter [@doi:10.7759/cureus.13594].
These on-the-ground treatment strategies could then be analyzed retrospectively in observational studies or investigated in an interventional paradigm through randomized control studies.

In addition to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as encouraging non-intubated patients to adopt a prone position [@doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.3030], knowledge about how hCoV interact with the human body led to the suggestion that a number of common drugs might provide benefits for COVID-19 patients.
The administration and assessment of such treatments on a rapid time course was feasible because they are often either available in hospitals, or in some cases may also be prescribed to a large number of patients.
One of the other advantages is that these well-established compounds, if found to be beneficial, tend to be more widely available than boutique experimental drugs.
In some cases, prior data was available from experiments examining the response of other hCoV or hCoV infections to a candidate.
There are four stories from the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic that are particularly illustrative of the different trajectories that analysis of these candidate treatments can follow.

#### Repurposing Based on Related Diseases

The three hCoV that have emerged in the past twenty years have presented serious threats, and therefore, clinical and pharmaceutical advancements in treating them have been of significant interest.
Because the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic follows on the heels of two prior hCoV outbreaks, efforts to repurpose drugs can, in theory, benefit from insights gained during these pandemics.
As described above, some of the interest in CQ/HCQ arose because of _in vitro_ studies of SARS-CoV-1.
However, the short duration and low case numbers of prior outbreaks were less well-suited to the large-scale study of clinical applications than the COVID-19 pandemic is.
As a result, COVID-19 has presented the opportunity to robustly evaluate treatments that were common during prior hCoV outbreaks to determine their clinical efficacy. 

Care for SARS and MERS patients prioritized supportive care and symptom management [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
<!--To Do: Steroids for SARS? long-SARS patients have damage from high doses of steroids so there must have been some use of steroids...-->
While clinical treatments for SARS and MERS were explored, there was generally a lack of evidence indicating whether they were effective.
For example, ribavirin is an antiviral drug effective against other viral infections that was often used in combination with corticosteroids and sometimes interferon (IFN) medications to treat SARS and MERS [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
However, analyses of its effects in retrospective and _in vitro_ analyses of SARS and the SARS-CoV-1 virus, respectively, have been inconclusive [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81], and while IFNs and ribavirin have shown promise in _in vitro_ analyses of MERS, their clinical effectiveness remains unknown [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
Similarly, this medication was pursued for COVID-19, but retrospective cohort analysis comparing patients who did and did not receive ribivarin revealed no effect on the mortality rate [@doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106114].
Therefore, experience with prior severe threats from hCoV provided some ideas of how to approach the treatment of COVID-19, but it was not clear how effective these measures would be.

However, one treatment adapted from prior hCoV outbreaks is currently the best known defense against death from COVID-19.
<!--To Do: look into exactly which steroids were used, why, when in illness course, and to what extent this included dexa-->
Dexamethasone (9&alpha;-fluoro-16&alpha;-methylprednisolone) is a synthetic corticosteroid that binds to glucocorticoid receptors [@doi:10.1021/cr068203e; @url:https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/dexamethasone/].
It functions as an anti-inflammatory agent by binding to glucocorticoid receptors with higher affinity than endogenous cortisol [@doi:10.1016/B978-0-323-48110-6.00034-X].
Dexamethasone and other steroids are widely available and affordable, and they are often used to treat community-acquired pneumonia [@doi:10.1038/s41392-020-0127-9].
A clinical trial that began in 2012 recently reported that dexamethasone may improve outcomes for patients with ARDS [@doi:10/ggpxzc].
However, a meta-analysis of a small amount of available data about dexamethasone as a treatment for SARS suggested that it may, in fact, be associated with patient harm [@doi:10/ggks86]; these findings may have been biased by the fact that all of the studies examined were observational and a large number of inconclusive studies were not included [@doi:10/ggq356].
Immunosuppressive drugs such as steroids are typically contraindicated in the setting of infection [@doi:10.1177/2040622313485275], but because COVID-19 results in hyperinflammation that appears to contribute to mortality via lung damage, immunosuppression may be a helpful approach to treatment [@doi:10/ggnzmc].
The decision of whether and/or when to counter hyperinflammation with immunosuppression in the setting of COVID-19 was an area of intense debate, as the risks of inhibiting antiviral immunity needed to be weighed against the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects [@doi:10/ggq8hs].
As a result, guidelines early in the pandemic typically recommended avoiding treating COVID-19 patients with corticosteroids such as dexamethasone [@doi:10/ggks86].

Despite this initial concern, dexamethasone was evaluated as part of the multi-site RECOVERY trial in the United Kingdom [@doi:10.1101/2020.06.22.20137273].
This study found that the 28-day mortality rate was lower in patients receiving dexamethasone than in those receiving SOC.
However, this finding was driven by differences in mortality among patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation or supplementary oxygen at the start of the study.
The report indicated that dexamethasone reduced 28-day mortality relative to SOC in patients who were ventilated (29.3% versus 41.4%) and among those who were receiving oxygen supplementation (23.3% versus 26.2%) at randomization, but not in patients who were breathing independently (17.8% versus 14.0%).
These findings also suggested that dexamethasone may have reduced progression to mechanical ventilation, especially among patients who were receiving oxygen support at randomization.
Other analyses have supported the importance of disease course in determining the efficacy of dexamethasone: additional results suggest greater potential for patients who have experienced symptoms for at least seven days and patients who were not breathing independently [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2021436].
A meta-analysis that evaluated the results of the RECOVERY trial alongside trials of other corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone, similarly concluded that corticosteroids may be beneficial to patients with severe COVID-19 who are receiving oxygen supplementation [@doi:10.1053/j.jvca.2020.11.057].
Thus, it seems likely that dexamethasone is useful for treating inflammation associated with immunopathy or cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is a condition caused by detrimental overactivation of the immune system [@individual-pathogenesis].
In fact, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone are sometimes used to treat CRS [@doi:10.1182/blood-2014-05-552729].
This affordable and widely available treatment has since become a valuable tool against COVID-19,and <!--To Do: some stats on usage since RECOVERY came out-->.

#### Repurposing Based on Mechanism

Prior analyses of the virological and pathogenic properties of SARS-CoV-1 and _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ (MERS-CoV) have provided a strong foundation for the development of hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 that offered insight into potential therapeutic approaches.
<!--To Do: Expand?-->

One of the most widely publicized analyses of whether a well-known medication could provide benefits to COVID-19 patients came from the assessment of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which are used for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria, as well as the treatment of lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis in adults [@dailymed-hcq].
These drugs are lysosomotropic agents, meaning they are weak bases that can pass through the plasma membrane, and it was thought that they might provide benefits against SARS-CoV-2 by interfering with the digestion of antigens within the lysosome and inhibiting CD4 T-cell stimulation while promoting the stimulation of CD8 T-cells [@doi:10.1111/j.1529-8019.2007.00131.x].
These compounds also have anti-inflammatory [@doi:10.1111/j.1529-8019.2007.00131.x] and can decrease the production of certain key cytokines involved in the immune response, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), and inhibit the stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and TLR signaling [@doi:10.1111/j.1529-8019.2007.00131.x].
_In vitro_ analyses reported that CQ inhibited cell entry of SARS-CoV-1 [@doi:10.1186/1743-422X-2-69] and that both CQ and HCQ inhibited viral replication within cultured cells [@doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa237], leading to early hope that it might provide similar therapeutic or protective effects in patients.
However, while the first publication on the clinical application of these compounds to the inpatient treatment of COVID-19 was very positive [@doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949], it was quickly discredited [@url:https://www.isac.world/news-and-publications/official-isac-statement].
Over the following months, extensive evidence emerged demonstrating that CQ and HCQ offered no benefits for COVID-19 patients and, in fact, carried the risk of dangerous side effects (see Appendix XX).
The nail in the coffin came when findings from the large-scale RECOVERY trial were released on October 8, 2020.
This study enrolled 11,197 hospitalized patients whose physicians believed it would not harm them to participate and used a randomized, open-label design to study the effects of HCQ compared to standard of care (SOC) at 176 hospitals in the United Kingdom [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2022926].
Rates of COVID-19-related mortality did not differ between the control and HCQ arms, but patients receiving HCQ were slightly more likely to die due to cardiac events.
Patients who received HCQ also had a longer duration of hospitalization than patients receiving usual care and were more likely to progress to mechanical ventilation or death (as a combined outcome).
As a result, enrollment in the HCQ arm of the RECOVERY trial was terminated early [@url:https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/statement-from-the-chief-investigators-of-the-randomised-evaluation-of-covid-19-therapy-recovery-trial-on-hydroxychloroquine-5-june-2020-no-clinical-benefit-from-use-of-hydroxychloroquine-in-hospitalised-patients-with-covid-19].
The story of CQ/HCQ therefore illustrates how initial promising _in vitro_ analyses can fail to translate to a useful clinical approach, even for a drug that has been on the market for many years.

While CQ/HCQ are well-known medications that have long been prescribed in certain contexts, investigation of another well-established type of pharmaceutical was facilitated by the fact that it was already being taken by a large number of COVID-19 patients.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are among today's most commonly prescribed medications, often being used to control blood pressure [@url:https://clincalc.com/DrugStats/Drugs/Lisinopril; @doi:10.1056/NEJMp1901657].
In the United States, for example, they are prescribed well over 100,000,000 times annually [@doi:10.18553/jmcp.2010.16.9.671].
<!-- To Do: check ARBs/ACEIs and SARS/MERS and add a sentence if that was explored-->
Data from some animal models suggest that several, but not all, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and several ARBs increase ACE2 expression in the cells of some organs [@doi:10.1093/cvr/cvaa097], but clinical studies have not established whether plasma ACE2 expression is increased in humans treated with these medications [@doi:10.1093/europace/euw246].
In this case, rather than introducing ARBs/ACEIs, a number of analyses have investigated whether discontinuing use affects COVID-19 outcomes.
An initial observational study of the association of exposure to ACEIs or ARBs with outcomes in COVID-19 was retracted from the _New England Journal of Medicine_ [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2007621] due to concerns related to data availability [@doi:10.1056/nejmc2021225].
As randomized trials have become available, they have demonstrated no effect of continuing versus discontinuing ARBs/ACEIs on patient outcomes [@doi:10/fvgt; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.25864] (Appendix XX).
Thus, once again, despite a potential mechanistic association with the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these medications were not found to influence the trajectory of COVID-19 illness.
However, because the medications were so widespread, clinical research was able to evaluate their efficacy very quickly.

### Notes
while therapeutics that directly target the virus itself would hold the potential to prevent people infected with SARS-CoV-2 from developing potentially damaging symptoms.
The treatments in this latter category typically fall into the broad category of antivirals.
Antiviral therapies hinder the spread of a virus within the host, rather than destroying existing copies of the virus, and these drugs can vary in their specificity to a narrow or broad range of viral targets.
For both categories, uncertainty often surrounds the treatments' exact mechanisms of action, as most therapies have secondary or off-target effects.
