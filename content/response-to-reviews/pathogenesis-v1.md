Reviewer 1

Rando et al., provide a thoughtful and comprehensive review of the scientific literature relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. This review will provide a useful resource for the scientific community but is missing some crucial information and would be improved by a more clear description of how this virus is detected and the limitations of these methods.

**
We are very grateful for your supportive words about this project and for your guidance in making our review of these topics more complete.
**

Major:
1.1 Heparin sulfate dependency: The 'Pathogenic mechanisms' section is lacking any reference to the dependence of SARS-Cov-2 binding to heparin sulfate which has been cited over 100 times since its publication in November and has been supported by work from numerous labs:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867420312307

**
This oversight has been corrected.
A discussion of heparan sulfate has now been added to the section "Pathogenic Mechanisms of Coronaviruses."
It reads: <!-- To do: add in text as it stands at submission-->
**

1.2 Furin discussion: The description of furin in this manuscript is confusing; it is highlighted in the conclusion as a mutation that has allowed for increased virulence, but is not mentioned in the opening paragraphs of the paper where host proteases are described (e.g. lines 229-235, line 279), or the section describing the hinge-like movement of the spike protein which is induced by furin (lines 591-603) and only mentioned fleetingly in the middle of a the next paragraph. A more thorough discussion of the furin-site insertion in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (and what information is still missing) earlier or more prominently in the paper is warranted.

1.3 Detected versus infectious: The distinction between RT-qPCR detection and viral infection assays in cell culture models should be more clear. Although this point is acknowledged (e.g. lines 713-714) it is not clear whether viral RNA or infectious virus is being described at certain points in the review (i.e. line 663) and a brief description of the advantages and limitations of these methods would be useful for the reader.

Minor:
1.4 Typos

    Lines 205; The legend of Figure 1 incorrectly states that RNA polymerase is a protease

**
The word "protease" has been changed to "enzyme."
**

    Line 709; typo -> 'either typical or atypical'

**
This change has been made.
**

    Line 755; 'content level' should be 'continental level'?

**
This change has been made.
**

    Line 788; what does adding the 'exposed' variable in this model mean and why is that important for SARS-CoV-2

**
This sentence has been modified to read "To accurately capture the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, the addition of a fourth compartment, i.e. a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, may be appropriate because such models account for the relative lengths of incubation and infectious periods" and now includes a citation to Heng & Althaus (2020).
**

    Line 852; typo, duplicate 'has coordinated'

**
This typo has been corrected.
**

    Line 874; typo, "as in the current pandemic"

**
This change has been made.
**

1.5 This work is important not only for the current moment, but for contextualizing this virus for response to future outbreaks; in my opinion it would be nice to have a sentence in the discussion to this effect (this review represents a ton of work - the effort is worthwhile!)


Reviewer 2

Overall, this was a very comprehensive, thorough review of the current state of knowledge of SARS-CoV2. The manuscript is well written and extensively researched, with great attention to the details of the outbreak with regards to data from various regions of the world, providing an extremely useful resource for the scientific community. The manuscript is well researched and well written for a general scientific audience. I only had a handful of minor concerns, mostly for word choice/organization for clarity but I would leave these changes at the discretion of the authors as they do not detract from the overall narrative of the manuscript.

Minor Points

2.1 Line 196 - insert "the" prior to replication.

**
This change has been made.
**

2.2 Lines 213-214 - wording was a bit odd, might suggest adding "a process conserved among coronaviruses" to the previous sentence.

**
This change has been made.
**

2.3 Line 250-252 - might suggest excluding skin and just keeping mucus, the way this reads suggests the respiratory mucosa provides no protection at all- is this true?

**
The question you raised is interesting -- the Liu et al. (2016) reference, which investigated viral dissemination of SARS-CoV-1 in rhesus macaques, states, "Many viruses, including SARS-CoV, breach this mucosal barrier by infecting the epithelium directly."
This conclusion cites two articles, one of which (Richt et al., 2012 in PLoS One) examined swine influenza A virus (H2N3) in macaques and found higher replication of swine H2N3 than human H2N2 in the nasal mucosa and lung tissue.
The other (Nicholls et al., 2006 in PLoS Medicine) reported the cellular localization of the SARS-CoV-1 virus in deceased SARS patients using a monoclonal antibody, concluding that the virus's "chief target" is the pulmonary alveolar epithelium.
Based on these citations, it doesn't seem appropriate to conclude that the respiratory mucosa does not provide protection at all, but rather that viruses vary in their ability to bypass its protection.
Based on this, the sentence has been rephrased to read: "Infecting the epithelium can help viruses such as SARS-CoV-1 bypass the physical barriers, such as mucus, that comprise the immune system's first line of defense."
<!--To Do: add final version of sentence-->
**

2.4 Line 275 - suggest changing "can facilitate" to "may facilitate"

**
This change has been made.
**

2.5 Line 311 - reference was not highlighted in blue- not sure if this was a formatting issue but may want to check to make sure this reference is correct.

**
Thank you for catching this error.
The correct reference is a June 2020 letter to the editor in the New England Journal of Medicine (doi:10.1056/NEJMc2010419).
This line has been corrected to refer to the correct article.
**

2.6 Might suggest moving up the Pediatric Presentation (Lines 428-454) to immediately before cytokine release syndrome as it follows the clinical presentation and directly leads into the cytokine release syndrome.

**
This change has been made.
**

2.7 The intro paragraph for the cytokine release syndrome is quite long and could be readily shortened (or even eliminated) without sacrificing the relevant information pertaining to COVID-19 (which is primarily the second 2 paragraphs).

2.8 Might suggest moving the cytokine section to be under the Systems-Level Effects rather than Clinical Presentation section, but it could fit in either.

2.9 Line 505 - statement regarding other respiratory viruses encoding antagonists to IFN response should reference the relevant studies.

2.10 Line 513 - word choice- replace extent with magnitude.

**
This change has been made.
**

2.11 Lines 557-559 - this was a really intriguing statement- can the authors provide an additional sentence or two to provide additional context to why this might be the case?

2.12 I understand that this field moves ridiculously fast, but in the transmission section it might be worth including the most recent variants that are predicted to have increased transmission.

**
Thank you for this suggestion.
A discussion of variants of concern has been added to the section "Molecular Signatures and Transmission," which has been renamed to "Molecular Signatures, Transmission, and Variants of Concern."

Reviewer 3

Overall, the manuscript by Rando et al seeks to review and condense the current corpus of knowledge for SARS-CoV-2. The authors do a great job of making the findings of various studies easy to understand. Overall, this reviewer believes that it will be an excellent resource to the scientific community. This reviewer recommends that the author incorporates a handful of suggested changes (below) to improve the already impressive state of this manuscript.

3.1 Structure of Coronaviruses, paragraph 1: Please modify the definition of “non-segmented”. It refers more to the fact that it is a single molecule of ssRNA, than to whether it is contained in a capsid.

**
This error has been correct.
The text now reads:
"They are non-segmented, which means the viral genome is a single continuous strand of DNA, and are enveloped, which means that the geno    me and capsid are encased by a lipid bilayer."
<!--To do: confirm final version-->
**

3.2 Cytokine release syndrome, paragraph 1: Please modify the wording from “dysregulated systemic inflammation can cause sepsis…” to something similar to “dysregulated systemic inflammation can contribute to pathogenesis associated with sepsis”. The reviewer is unsure about the relevance of this sentence since sepsis is associated with bacterial infection rather than viral infection.

3.3 Cytokine release syndrome, paragraph 2: The relevance of sepsis to this paragraph is also unclear, unless the authors are comparing SARS-CoV-2 infection to other respiratory diseases caused by bacteria. Specifying the relevance of this comparison would be helpful.

3.4 Molecular signatures and transmission: It may be helpful to the readers if the authors included a brief synopsis of viral comparative genomics analyses that have been performed including:

    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673620317578
    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421000805
    https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/17/e00790-20.abstract
    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420304864

3.5 Conclusions, paragraph 3: The same reference (222) is included twice for the same statement.

**
This duplication has been removed.
