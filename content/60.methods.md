## An Open-Publishing Response to the COVID-19 Infodemic

### ABSTRACT

In an effort to keep pace as new information about COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 becomes available, this project is an open, collaborative effort that invited contributions from the scientific community broadly, similar to previous efforts to develop collaborative reviews [@doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0387; @url:https://greenelab.github.io/deep-review].

### KEYWORDS

### INTRODUCTION

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has shaped the years 2020 and 2021 by causing a world-wide public health crisis.
The scientific community has responded by turning significant attention and resources towards COVID-19 and the associated virus, SARS-CoV-2.
The result has been the rapid release of data, results, and publications related to COVID-19 at a scale never previously seen.
Over 20,000 articles about COVID-19 were released in the first 4 months of the pandemic [@doi:10.1053/j.ackd.2020.08.003].
The velocity and volume of information being released led to the pandemic being termed as an "infodemic" as well [@doi:10.1053/j.ackd.2020.08.003; @doi:10/ggpx67].
While this influx of information is likely evidence of important work towards understanding the virus and the disease, there are also downsides to the availability of too much information.
The potential for "excessive publication" has been identified as an issue for over forty years, and was one concern about the move towards electronic, rather than print, publishing at the turn of the millennium [@doi:10/d3bmnv].

<!-- To Do: This is just an outline, formalize this paragraph with citations etc-->
While some of this information has been disseminated by traditional publishing mechanisms, in other cases, it is made public through preprint servers or even press releases.
Preprints provide a venue for scientists to release findings rapidly, but have both the advantage and disadvantage of making research available before it has undergone the peer review process.
Media outlets don't always report on this accurately.
Additionally, many papers are being retracted.
These include both preprints and papers that are published in more traditional venues.
The large number of retractions may also be influenced by the fact that the time from submission to peer review for papers related to COVID-19 is very low.

The rate of this proliferation also presents challenges to efforts to summarize and synthesize existing literature, which are necessary given the volume.
Any static review is likely to quickly become dated as more research is released or, in some cases, retracted or superseded.
Additionally, the complex nature of COVID-19 means that significant advantages can be gained from examining the virus and disease in a multidisciplinary context.
Therefore, the COVID-19 publishing climate presented a challenge where curation of the literature by a diverse group of experts in a format that could respond quickly to high-volume, high-velocity information was desirable.
Here, we describe efforts to adapt an existing open publishing platform, Manubot, to handle the extreme case of the COVID-19 infodemic.

The problem of synthesizing the COVID-19 literature lends itself well to a crowd-sourced approach to writing through open collaboration.
In biology, such efforts often rely on WYSIWYG tools such as Google Docs; however, there are a number of limitations to such approaches.<!--To Do: check what the Manubot paper says about this and possibly pull some other refs-->
Recent advances in open publishing have created an infrastructure that facilitates distributed, version-controlled collaboration on manuscripts [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].
Manubot [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128] is a collaborative framework developed to adapt open-source software development techniques and version control for manuscript writing.
It allows for manuscripts to be managed and maintained using GitHub, a popular, online version control interface that also provides the infrastructure via continuous integration (CI) to incorporate code into the manuscript building process to allow, for example, figures to be continuously updated based on an external data set..
However, these tools are not typically associated with biomedical research, yet synthesis and discussion of the emerging literature by biomedical scientists and clinicians would be expected to provide novel insights into how various areas of COVID-19 research intersect.

The goal of the COVID-19 Collaborative Review community was to consolidate information about the virus in the context of related viruses and to synthesize rapidly emerging literature centered on the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
Manubot provided the infrastructure to manage contributions from the community and create a living, scholarly document.
We designed software to generate figures that automatically update using external data sources. <!-- TODO: replace figure reference with manuscript reference or reference figure conditionally based on template variable [, such as Figure @fig:csse-deaths,] -->
Our primary goal was to provide the backend for scientists to sort and distill informative content out of the overwhelming flood of information [@doi:10.1038/s42254-020-0175-7] and help the broader scientific community become more conversant on this critical subject.
Thus, our approach has been to develop a real-time, collaborative effort that welcomes submissions from scientists worldwide into this ongoing effort.
This case study demonstrates the value of open collaborative writing tools such as Manubot to emerging crises such as COVID-19.
By allowing us to keep a record of the evolution of information over time and to create figures and in-line text that autoupdated alongside the state of the world, it revealed the particular value that Manubot holds for managing a rapid changes in scientific thought.

### Methods

#### Description of the Problem

<!--To Do: Plot the number of pubs in CORD-19 over time?-->

As many other efforts have described, the rate of publishing of formal manuscripts and preprints about COVID-19 was unprecedented [@doi:10.1053/j.ackd.2020.08.003].
Additionally, the broader topic of COVID-19 intersects with a wide range of fields, including virology, immunology, medicine, pharmacology, evolutionary biology, public health, and more.
Therefore, any effort to comprehensively document and evaluate this body of literature would require insight from scientists across a number of fields.
Furthermore, during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic during spring and summer 2020, and much longer in some part of the world, many biological scientists were unable to access their research spaces.
As a result, early career researchers (ECR) and students were likely to lose out on valuable time for conducting experiments. <!--To Do: look at equity analyses of the effects on the pandemic to see if there is any data on this yet?-->

#### Contributor Recruitment and Community Building

Given the limitations imposed upon scientists by the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures that had most scientists (including students) working from home for much of 2020, community building across disciplines and across career stages was a priority of the project.
Contributors were recruited by word of mouth and on Twitter.
Existing efforts to train early-career scientists were also integrated: Appendix A contains summaries written by the students, post-docs, and faculty of the Immunology Institute at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine [@url:https://github.com/ismms-himc/covid-19_sinai_reviews; @doi:10.1038/s41577-020-0319-0], and two of the authors were recruited through the American Physician Scientist Association's Virtual Summer Research Program [@url:https://www.physicianscientists.org/page/summer-research-pilot-program].

Interested parties were encouraged to contribute in a number of ways.
One option was to submit articles of interest as issues in the GitHub repository.
Articles were classified as _diagnostic_, _therapeutic_, or _other_, and a template was developed to guide the review of papers and preprints in each category.
Following a framework often used for assessing medical literature, the review consisted of examining methods used in each relevant article, assignment (whether the study was observational or randomized), assessment, results, interpretation, and how well the study extrapolates [@doi:10.5014/ajot.60.4.367].
For examples of each template, please see Appendices B-D.
Another option was to contribute or edit text using GitHub's pull request system.
Each pull request was reviewed and approved by at least one other author.
Manubot also provides a functionality to create a bibliography using digital object identifiers (DOIs), website URLs, or other identifiers such as PubMed identifiers and arXiv IDs.
The GitHub implementation allowed users to contribute either using git on the command line or using the GitHub user interface, and we developed documentation for users with less experience with this platform.

Few researchers in biological and medical fields are trained in version control tools such as git <!--To Do: Find some sort of reference for this, software carpentry?-->
The current project was managed through GitHub [@url:https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review] using Manubot [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128] to continuously generate a version of the manuscript online [@url:https://greenelab.github.io/covid19-review].
As a result, we expanded upon the baseline Manubot training materials in an effort to guide efforts by scientists with no background in GitHub or version control to contribute.
<!--To Do: Short description of efforts to develop additional training resources-->

The data regarding contributions was analyzed using GitHub's continuous integration features.
<!--To Do: Describe how all the graphs we decide to go with were made, see results for ideas-->

#### Applying Manubot to COVID-19 

Because of the ever-evolving nature of the COVID-19 crisis, many of the figures and text proposed by subject matter contributors would have quickly become outdated.
To address this concern, Manubot and GitHub's continuous integration features were used to create figures and text that could respond to changes in the COVID-19 pandemic over time.
The combination of Manubot and GitHub Actions also made it possible to dynamically update information such as statistics and visualizations in the manuscript.
When scientific writers added text that was current only as of a given date, publicly available data sources were identified whenever possible to allow the information to pulled directly into the manuscript in order to keep it up-to-date.

Data was pulled from a number of sources.
Data about worldwide cases and deaths from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University [@https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series] were read using a Python script. <!-- To Do: replace figure reference with manuscript reference or reference figure conditionally based on template variable [to generate Figure @fig:csse-deaths.] -->
Similarly, the clinical trials statistics and figure were generated based on data from the University of Oxford Evidence-Based Medicine Data Lab's COVID-19 TrialsTracker [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3732709]. <!-- TODO: replace figure reference with manuscript reference or reference figure conditionally based on template variable [Figure @fig:ebm-trials] -->
In both cases, frequency data were plotted using Matplotlib [@doi:10.1109/MCSE.2007.55] in Python.
The figure showing the geographic distribution of COVID-19 clinical trials was generated using the countries associated with the trials listed in the COVID-19 TrialsTracker, converting the country names to 3-letter ISO codes using pycountry or manual adjustment when necessary, and visualizing the geographic distribution of trial recruitment using geopandas. <!-- TODO: replace figure reference with manuscript reference or reference figure conditionally based on template variable [Figure @fig:ebm-map] -->
<!--To Do: Update with Vaccines-->

GitHub Actions runs a nightly workflow to update these external data and regenerate the statistics and figures for the manuscript.
The workflow uses the GitHub API to detect and save the latest commit of the external data sources, which are both GitHub repositories.
It then downloads versioned data from that snapshot of the external repositories and runs bash and Python scripts to calculate the desired statistics and produce the summary figures.
The statistics are stored in JSON files that are accessed by Manubot to populate the values of placeholder template variables dynamically every time the manuscript is built.
For instance, the template variable {% raw %}`{{ebm_trials_results}}`{% endraw %} in the manuscript is replaced by the actual number of clinical trials with results, {{ebm_trials_results}}.
The template variables also include versioned URLs to the dynamically updated figures.
The JSON files and figures are stored in the `external-resources` branch of the manuscript's GitHub repository, which acts as versioned storage.
The GitHub Actions workflow automatically adds and commits the new JSON files and figures to the `external-resources` branch every time it runs, and Manubot uses the latest version of these resources when it builds the manuscript.
The workflow file is available from <https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review/blob/master/.github/workflows/update-external-resources.yaml> and the scripts are available from <https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review/tree/external-resources>.
The Python package versions are available in <https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review/blob/external-resources/environment.yml>.
<!-- To Do: These files are archived with [Software Heritage](...). -->

Additionally, the fast-moving nature of the infodemic has led to a number of retractions and corrections of COVID-19 literature.
<!--To Do: Describe integration with scite -- unless this should go in the section below? Ask Vince -->  

#### Updates to Manubot

<!-- To Do: Describe Ryan's work making it possible to cite clinical trial identifiers-->
<!-- To Do: Also, if we end up automating the Manubot-to-LaTeX workflow while trying to submit this paper, we should describe that too-->
Due to the needs of this project, project contributors also implemented new features in Manubot and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), which Manubot uses to extract metadata for some types of citations.
These features support directly citing clinical trial identifiers such as `clinicaltrials:NCT04292899` [@clinicaltrials:NCT04292899] and generating the complete review manuscript along with the individual manuscripts reviewing specific topics. <!-- To Do: reference individual manuscripts -->

<!--To Do: This is old text, separate out into intro what was pre-existing and here what was added over the course of this project-->
Finally, Manubot and GitHub Actions continuous integration allowed for scripted updates to be run each time the manuscript was generated.
These scripts were used to check that the manuscript was built correctly, run spellchecking, and cross-reference the manuscripts cited in this review, summarized in Appendix A, and discussed in the project's issues and pull requests.

### Conclusions

![**Summary of the relationships among topics covered in this review.**](images/N000-overview.png){#fig:overview secno=1}

Several review articles on aspects of COVID-19 have already been published.
These have included reviews on the disease epidemiology [@doi:10.1016/j.molmed.2020.02.008], immunological response [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.05.002], diagnostics [@doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abc1931], and pharmacological treatments [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.05.002; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6019].
Others [@doi:10.1038/d41591-020-00026-w; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12839] provide narrative reviews of progress on some important ongoing COVID-19 research questions.
With the worldwide scientific community uniting during 2020 to investigate SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 from a wide range of perspectives, findings from many disciplines are relevant on a rapid timescale to a broad scientific audience.
Additionally, many findings are published as preprints, which are available prior to going through the peer review process.
As a result, centralizing, summarizing, and critiquing new literature broadly relevant to COVID-19 can help to expedite the interdisciplinary scientific process that is currently happening at an advanced pace.
We are particularly interested in providing background to the development of diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic approaches to COVID-19.
Two major concerns within diagnosis include the detection of current infections in individuals with and without symptoms, and the detection of past exposure without an active infection.
In the latter category, identifying whether individuals can develop or have developed sustained immunity is also a major consideration.
The development of high-throughput, affordable methods for detecting active infections and sustained immunity will be critical to understanding and controlling the disease.
The identification of interventions that can mitigate the effect of the virus on exposed and infected individuals is a significant research priority.
Some possible approaches include the identification of existing pharmaceuticals that reduce the severity of infection, either by reducing the virus' virulence (e.g., antivirals) or managing the most severe symptoms of infection.
Due to the long timeline for the development of novel pharmaceuticals, in most cases, research surrounding possible pharmaceutical interventions focuses on the identification and investigation of existing compounds whose mechanisms may be relevant to COVID-19.
Other foci of current research include the identification of antibodies produced by survivors of COVID-19 and the development of vaccines.
Understanding the mechanisms describing host-virus interactions between humans and SARS-CoV-2 is thus critical to identifying candidate therapeutics.
An overview of the topics covered is visualized in Figure @fig:overview.
Thus, in this review, we seek to consolidate information about efforts to develop strategies for diagnosis and therapeutics as new information is released by the scientific community.
We include information from both traditional peer-reviewed scientific literature and from preprints, which typically have not undergone peer review but have been critically evaluated by the scientists involved in this effort.
The goal of this manuscript is to present preliminary findings within the broader context of COVID-19 research and to identify the broad interpretations of new research, as well as limitations to interpretability.
